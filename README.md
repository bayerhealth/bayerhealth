This is Hadamard's (@khknopp, @Trzyq0712) solution to the task "Hunger for None" in the Bayer Hackathon 2021 (28.05-30.05)

The datasets we used can be found in ```datasets.md```.

This program was tested under Arch Linux. To start the ```Flask``` webserver run:
```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py```
