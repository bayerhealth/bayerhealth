Evidence has shown that supplements etc aren't effective against this virus. Strengthening your immune system is fine. This doesn't solve mask wearing. If you're talking about people only having one mask and being poor they definitely cant afford supplements.
The mask information about CO2 etc is simply incorrect. The increase in CO2 / decrease of O2 for the time it takes to do a shopping trip or something is negligible at best. If you've been in a bedroom with the door closed... technically there's an increase of CO2 and a decrease of available O2. It is similar levels in these cases with the average persons mask.
Be careful reading things that seem scientific but are using fringe numbers as proof.
You feeling like you can't breathe is because you aren't used to it. I absolutely hated masks when I had to wear them for insulation... painting..etc. those were rare times. With this I force myself to. Guess what.... not a big deal anymore. I got used to it. That's a mindset issue and it does take time to train ourselves. It's like driving. When you first get behind the wheel your unsure of yourself. A year later your hoping in and doing everything second nature.
Generic cotton masks prevent about 20% exposure for wearer but limit about 80% spread of droplets and or droplet dispersion. Ultimately they do help. People not wearing them are just being lazy and acting like petulant children.

4,2020-06-02 11:11:00,Supplements that changed your life? (Hopefully for the better.),"
I regularly take a multivitamin as well as fish oil, magnesium, echinacea, and now a zinc/vit c/vit d combo. Since I take them so regularly I’ll just outline the ones I feel a noticeable difference from and when
Magnesium I feel a huge difference for post-workout soreness. Helps with muscle relaxation. If I had done a heavier workout/run and do not take magnesium post-meal I personally feel way more sore the next day.
Echinacea I started because I had read it helps keep the endocannabinoid system healthy and I was trying to lessen my cannabis use. The tolerance breaks with it help me personally but more research/others’ experiences needed. In general I think it’s a healthy supplement to be taking for immunity too.
I take a vit B supplement about 3 times a week. My multivitamin isn’t that strong on the B vitamins and my blood tests say I’m deficient in B12. Not sure if anyone shares this experience but if I take the B vitamin before a night of drinking I’m less hungover or don’t get muscle spasms (which I read because your body goes through B vitamins to process alcohol). So there’s where I feel a noticeable difference.

Your body is using the D, and it was already at a deficit before beginning supplementation. If you’re experiencing any type of immune dysregulation there will be a higher demand. Therapeutic doses of 10,000 IU are not uncommon. Obviously speak with your practitioner, but it should help. Not hurt.
Take your D in the morning. It’s a hormone, and can affect sleep. There should be no fear about taking magnesium with calcium. D is what orchestrates where the calcium goes; your body knows how to handle calcium (unless in mega doses, like with straight Ca pills).
Adding in vitamin K with your D will help to store it in bones vs tissues if blood thinners aren’t an issue. Magnesium will help—it’s arguably the most important mineral and we’re all deficient—but not having it for a day shouldn’t stop you from taking a supplement.

Why would wearing masks outdoors be helpful? Close indoor contact with people is how it's spread mostly. I can see outdoor use of masks if you are in a crowd, which we should be avoiding anyway.

To evaluate the efficacy of existing vaccines against infection with SHC014-MA15, we vaccinated aged mice with double-inactivated whole SARS-CoV (DIV). Previous work showed that DIV could neutralize and protect young mice from challenge with a homologous virus14; however, the vaccine failed to protect aged animals in which augmented immune pathology was also observed, indicating the possibility of the animals being harmed because of the vaccination15. Here we found that DIV did not provide protection from challenge with SHC014-MA15 with regards to weight loss or viral titer (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). Consistent with a previous report with other heterologous group 2b CoVs15, serum from DIV-vaccinated, aged mice also failed to neutralize SHC014-MA15 (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Notably, DIV vaccination resulted in robust immune pathology (Supplementary Table 4) and eosinophilia (Supplementary Fig. 5d–f). Together, these results confirm that the DIV vaccine would not be protective against infection with SHC014 and could possibly augment disease in the aged vaccinated group.

We found that higher concentrations of anti-sera against SARS-CoV neutralized SARS-CoV infection, while highly diluted anti-sera significantly increased SARS-CoV infection and induced higher levels of apoptosis. Results from infectivity assays indicate that SARS-CoV ADE is primarily mediated by diluted antibodies against envelope spike proteins rather than nucleocapsid proteins. We also generated monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins and observed that most of them promoted SARS-CoV infection. Combined, our results suggest that antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins may trigger ADE effects. The data raise new questions regarding a potential SARS-CoV vaccine, while shedding light on mechanisms involved in SARS pathogenesis.

Sorry to hear that you got it when using a condom, that must be very frustrating. I’m not sure if it should be included in full scan, but the doctors should definitely inform their patients that it is not included.
Also, including it in the scan will help break the stigma. It is very common, but people don’t realize this because so many people are asymptomatic.
The claim is that it’s not worth informing someone who is asymptomatic because behavior is rarely changed and it’s not worth the toll on their mental health.
Well ... what about the person’s mental and physical health that they unknowingly transmit to.
If more people asymptomatically test positive, it will bring awareness to the prevalence herpes.
Awareness to the prevalence will help tear down the stigma.
Tearing down the stigma will lessen the mental health issues associated with a positive test for someone asymptomatic.
Also, I think a lot of people who are asymptomatic but test positive would do their best to prevent transmission.
There are very simple things that can be done to help lower the risk of transmission if people were educated. Like avoid sex if you have irritation on your genitals, use lube to prevent irritation, don’t have sex if you are sick and your immune system is not at its best, take supplements to boost your immune system.

Not here to argue with anyone who thinks differently.
Masks are not healthy. It confines you to breathing carbon dioxide, decreases oxygen intake, increases infection risk by triggering Dorman retro-viruses already existing in our bodies), it has you breathing in the germs from the inside of the used mask constantly. Not everyone has massive amounts of mask to use and discard. Some only have ONE.
I personally cannot breathe well and feel asphysiated while wearing it.
How about the medical establishment instead informs the public to increase intake of nutrients such as Vitamin D3 (20 min out in the sun daily), Vitamin C, Magnesium Glycinate, Zinc, and a good bio-available B-100 Complex (don't forget the Vitamin E and Omega 3s).
To each their own, but this is what we do and no one has gotten ill.
They keep dickering around about wearing masks, etc, but don't teach how to strengthen the immune system. Smh.
If they insist on a face covering, I'd rather just use the plastic cover, not a face hugging mask.
If everyone's immune system was strong from proper nutrition and supplementation, I do believe the virus would die in its tracks.
I don't hear anyone saying that and felt I had to say it.
Peace.

You may want to re-read those articles, they tell you something different than you think.
They tell you that an individual that is exposed to farm animals develops a sturdier immune system than an individual who isn't, not that we developed a hereditary trait for a stronger immune system. The same applies to exposure to sandpits or groups of kindergarten toddlers, by the way.
In short, if we train our immune systems to respond to threats at an early age, they become more resilient. If we then have kids that don't get that exposure at an early age, their immune systems do not become as resilient. It is a trait induced by exposure, not by changed genetics.
Edit: and I think moving towards tech that can replace immune systems is the worst idea ever. Supplement it, sure. Develop techniques to train it (with artificial proteins or so), sure. But replace it with external medication is suicide as a species.

The mother and the fetus do not share the same blood. The function of the placenta is to facilitate the exchange of nutrients, gases, and wastes while keeping the blood supplies separate. There are a type of antibodies called IgG that can cross the placenta. They give some protection to the developing fetus in utero. After birth, IgG and IgA antibodies are transferred to the baby through breast milk. While the baby is breastfeeding, it has the same immunities as the mother does (including those the mother acquired through vaccination). Babies start to make their own antibodies by three months, but their immune systems will be supplemented by maternal antibodies until they are weaned. After weaning, maternal antibodies in the baby's blood eventually degrade, so they will have to be vaccinated to develop their own antibodies.

I was sick for about 25 days, but when I say sick, I was just not well.. the symptoms were VERY mild, but noticeable.

I would say make sure you are taking Vitamin C, D3 and Zinc supplements, as those are crucial for immune functionality and most people are deficient on D and Zinc. I take 5,000iu/day D3 and 50mg of Zinc. I believe it significantly reduced the symptoms.

Covid-19 and Vitamin D, 2-Page Summary Dr Gareth Davies (PhD), Dr Joanna Byers (MBChB), Dr Attila R Garami (MD, PhD)
This document is for medical professionals only.
Evidence strongly suggests Vitamin D supplements could be effective in preventing Covid-19, and play a key role in treating patients if added to existing treatment plans, especially if this is done early in the disease progression.
Full report: bit.ly/VitDCovid19Info
Call for data: we ask ICUs to test serum levels, add D3 to treatment plans, measure outcomes and report. Please also measure 25(OH)D serum levels in post mortem examinations up to 10 days after death, especially in cases with no apparent comorbidities. Early clinical evidence will support clinical trial applications. Please Test, Treat, Measure, Report.
High Level Summary Vitamin D deficiency is common during winter (Oct - Mar) in northern latitudes above 20 degrees and (Apr - Sep) in southern latitudes 20 degrees below the equator. (Mithal et al. 2009)(Isaia et al. 2003)(Garland and Garland 2006)(Giustina et al. 2019)
Coronaviruses and influenza viruses in the past have displayed very strong seasonality with winter appearances (Gaunt et al. 2010). Severe Covid-19 outbreaks have happened above 20 degree winter latitudes whereas outbreaks in the southern summer hemisphere have been mild and case fatalities relatively low. Case fatalities show a striking relationship to latitude. (23-Mar-2020. See Figure 1.
The most severe outbreak in the north has been Italy where it is noted vitamin D deficiency is one of the highest in Europe (Watkins 2020).
Japan is an outlier in the north, with only a very mild outbreak and has the lowest incidence of Vitamin D deficiency thanks to its high fish-content diet (Mithal et al. 2009). [NB: Other factors no doubt contribute in both countries but culture and behaviour account for speed of spread not case fatality rates].
Research suggests SARS-Cov-2 virus enters cells via ACE2(Hoffmann et al., n.d.). Coronavirus viral replication downregulates ACE2(Dijkman et al. 2012) dysregulating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and leads to a cytokine storm(Ji et al. 2020)(Chen et al. 2010) in the host, causing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
Research shows that Vitamin D acts to rebalance RAS(Kong et al. 2013)(Yuan W n.d.) and attenuates lung injury(Kong et al. 2013)(Xu et al. 2017).
Research shows that Vitamin D supplementation increases immunity and reduces inflammatory responses(Jiménez-Sousa et al. 2018) and the risk of acute respiratory tract infection(Martineau et al. 2017).
Vitamin D deficiency is strongly associated with ARDS(Dancer et al. 2015) and poor mortality outcomes(Ednan K. Bajwa , Ishir Bhan , Sadeq Quraishi , Michael Matthay , B. T. Thompson 2016), as well as being associated with many comorbidities associated with Covid-19 case fatalities.
High dose oral Vitamin D has been shown to improve mortality in patients with severe vitamin D deficiency.(Christopher 2016)
Chronic vitamin D deficiency induces lung fibrosis through activation of the RAS.(Et al 2017)
Vitamin D is a steroid hormone naturally produced in the skin in summer exposure to UVB light. It is considered safe to take as cholecalciferol (D3) oral supplements in doses up to a maximum of 4,000iu/d for short periods (“Vitamin D and Health - SACN” 2016). NICE recommends daily supplements for all UK adults all year(“Colecalciferol - NICE, BNF” n.d.) (“Scenario: Prevention of Vitamin D Deficiency in Adults - NICE” 2018)

Here's (yet) another naive, first-person theory, but honestly with so many experts so stumped, what have we got to lose?
I think you're right that it may hide and come out again, but just re-appearing (or constantly being in the background) is not the real problem.
The real problem is that, due to the ubiquity of ACE2 receptors all over the body, organs, arterial wall etc... Each resurgence is a new area of attack.
So... in my case... Digestion first!
Later it went to my throat / upper-respiratory, but my body had already been developing some resistance (antibodies?) due to the first weeks of digestion / intestinal issues...
Then my second relapse was lungs / endothelial, where the virus found fresh ground. But by serious concentration on sleep, diet, supplements, my already-primed immune system got there in time.
Last couple of weeks, new headaches and ear-aches, but recovery in just a couple of days.
So maybe...
-- Short-timers / asymptomatics had immune response all over it fast...
-- Severe cases got a big viral load and it spread to too many places simultaneously, so lungs/blood/kidney were like three front-lines that the immune system has trouble with the sheer quantity...
-- And long-timers like us are somewhere in between?

I would maybe mention to the adults that you suspect someone could be a carrier, so to try whatever supplement daily to try to head that off.

That's nice. But RCT's have been done and found that Selenium supplementation increases the immune system's ability to clear viruses from the body and increase T helper cell activity along with interferon production. Regardless of age.
Magnesium has been found to reduce inflammation in the body and assist the immune system.
Vitamin C is essential to the proper functioning of the immune system and the cellular integrity of the body itself. Without it one will literally perish.
So it's not an ""under the cold light of RCT's supplements fail.""
Furthermore, doctors are trained in interventionist medicine not preventative medicine. That's how they make their money after all. And most don't understand the concept even if you explained it to them.
So for example there is no number of studies proving that magnesium and potassium reduce blood pressure that will ever convince them to recommend those nutrients over beta blockers and ace inhibitors because there's no money there. Low blood pressure = no doctor visits for blood pressure.
And so on for other conditions that can be remedied through nutritional supplementation.

Significantly lower antibody titers were observed in the 17-month old mice at both doses (Fig. 4A), when compared to 2- and 8-month old mice, suggesting that higher doses and/or additional booster doses may be required in the most immune senescent populations to induce sufficient immunity.

It’s mostly just synthetic chemicals and fillers and nasty byproducts your body will just piss out. A huge issue is malabsorption so even if you’re eating high quality foods you could still be having a problem. Not to mention the nutrient depletion in soil from modern agriculture. Get a high quality d3+k2 supplement (I got mine from this site called surthrival i think). Eat some grass fed beef liver and salmon roe and maybe some bone broth once a week and you’ll probably be good to go. I take some mushrooms (lions mane I like a lot) as they say it’s a huge adaptogen and immune system booster. I’ve been hearing about copper and zinc supplementation but I don’t know enough to comment on that. The human body is fine not getting everything everyday in the perfect doses so just develop a daily prayer or meditation routine to lower your stress and you’ll be in the top percentile of health and well being. Stress is the modern killer. Along with being a fast food eating fatty of course haha. I’ve done some juice fasting and water fasting as well to give the body time to rest and heal.

The fucked up irony is that the people most vulnerable to systemic racism and police brutality are also the ones that are most vulnerable to dying of the virus which is almost certainly spreading like wildfire during the protests.
For what it’s worth, there have been studies that support the theory that an increase in Vitamin D (via supplements) encourages a stronger immunity to fight COVID-19. This is one of the factors for those with darker skin being disproportionately affected by it... black people generally have lower levels of vitamin D, due to the melanin in their skin, and don’t often supplement with vitamins. Caucasian people, however, will tend to have higher levels of vitamin D. We see evidence of this in Scandinavian countries where despite the fact that sunlight is lacking, people regularly supplement Vitamin D in their diets as well as fortify their food and drink with vitamin d. TL;DR: Take Vitamin D every day. Worst case, it does nothing, best case it does help your immune system in fighting COVID.

Several of my friends also tested negative and had the same symptoms as I did. Your def in the clear now bc it was back in May but anyone else reading this who has recently experienced these symptoms, I would recommend getting retested if you got a negative. A few nurses told me that there are a lot of false negatives (rarely false positives though).
This is what helped me: - lots of water - lots of sleep & down time (reduce stress) - normal daily multi-vitamin - vitamin D, C & omega 3 supplements - oregano immune booster - beet & pure organic cranberry juice - hot tea with honey (non caffeinated) - sunlight & fresh air
I mostly ate soup, bread, fruit & sautéed veggies.... any kind of meat didn’t seem very appetizing to me for some reason so iron pills might be good too but I survived without them. I only took Tylenol when migraines became severe. I also had CBD gummies)
Random Note: If you experience slightly severe symptoms with breathing go to the hospital and they will prescribe you with “Dexamethasone”. This helped my friend who had a severe anxiety induced panic attack because her breathing became labored.
Hope this helps!! :)

If anything, this pandemic should be teaching everyone to take better care of themselves. It starts with washing your hands and maybe wearing a mask. But it also means taking care of your immune system, taking vitamins or supplements every day, eating better, losing weight, and quitting things that are bad for you like smoking.

Not here to argue with anyone who thinks differently.
Masks are not healthy. It confines you to breathing carbon dioxide, decreases oxygen intake, increases infection risk by triggering Dorman retro-viruses already existing in our bodies), it has you breathing in the germs from the inside of the used mask constantly.
This information comes from Judy Mikovits, PhD. Look her up on YouTube. Not everyone has massive amounts of mask to use and discard. Some only have ONE.
I personally cannot breathe well and feel asphysiated while wearing it.
How about the medical establishment instead informs the public to increase intake of nutrients such as Vitamin D3 (20 min out in the sun daily), Vitamin C, Magnesium Glycinate, Zinc, and a good bio-available B-100 Complex (don't forget the Vitamin E and Omega 3s).
To each their own, but this is what we do and no one has gotten ill.
They keep dickering around about wearing masks, etc, but don't teach how to strengthen the immune system. Smh.
If they insist on a face covering, I'd rather just use the plastic cover, not a face hugging mask.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4890308/
It suggests that hypnotics promoting infections that increase inflammation is a potential pathway for a lot of the effects, and that GABAa agonism impairs the immune system.
Seems like there's not some hidden mechanism that could be avoided with other hypnotic drugs, it's the GABAa agonism itself causing the problems. There's probably a way to counter the immune changes by boosting your immune system and countering inflammation with other drugs/supplements, but the cancer risk seems more inevitable.

48,2019-08-14 08:18:00,Help me,"
For as long as i can remember i was paranoid i had some sort of parasite that was sapping my energy. I never really felt young and full of life and I always wanted to sleep more. I don’t have any real evidence to suggest that this wasn’t just simply depression.
My first alarming symptom started in the summer of 2014. Any time I started moving quickly—if I started running or swimming or even if I walked down the stairs too fast or simply fell—i would lose coordination in the right side of my body for about 2 seconds. My face droops on the right side, I can’t control my right arm, it feels like I’m about to have a stroke, and then it goes away. Neurologists found no abnormalities and simply told me to eat more. I’m 6’3” and weighed 150 pounds.
I then forced myself to eat more, and got up to 175, and nothing changed.
The second alarming symptom was debilitating knee pain after a double shift as a waiter in the summer of 2016, when I was 21. Turns out I had severe arthritis, the worst knees the orthopedic surgeon had ever seen on someone my age. I was never athletic, had no major knee injuries, and didn’t test positive for rheumatoid.
I started breathing heavier than normal, and friends asked me why i sounded like i was panting when i was just sitting and watching television. I went to allergists who said I have a severe dust allergy and possibly mild asthma, but that my breathing was normal.
I have no idea if this is relevant, but one time my ex’s car AC was leaking Freon, and she got it filled with more Freon, and the guy told her to let the car run for half an hour without driving it, but she didn’t tell me that and we started driving with the windows down. We both felt really woozy and tired and started disassociating, and then a couple hours later we both went to the emergency room. This was June 2017. About a month after this it started.
In a heatwave of July 2017 I got really tired and felt like I had Freon poisoning again. And then it didn’t go away. I was walking around like a zombie, droopy-eyed and slurring my words, and everyone at work laughed at me because of how obviously out of it i was. My parents told me I was just depressed. No one listened to me. My brain was shutting down, I couldn’t write anymore, no longer was capable of enjoying music, no longer capable of achieving or even working towards any of the things i wanted to accomplish with my life, and I decided if it went on like this for three months without improving I would kill myself. I felt then and still feel now that I didn’t make that decision out of depression, but rather out of the detached rationality of someone who has just received an Alzheimer’s diagnosis and doesn’t want to go on living as an utterly useless shell of who they once were and a burden to all those around them. Three months went by and i figured I made is this far, might as well keep going, and I’ve been living by that mentality since—some kind of combination of denial and resigned, baseless optimism. I had never heard of anyone falling suddenly and gravely ill for this length of time with no leads on any sort of treatment and then suddenly getting better. I figured there was no real reason I would ever get better other than that i just simply really wanted to, the way some people believe in heaven simply because they want it to be there.
In fact when I first got on this reddit it really depressed me, because I read all these personal testimonies and sad jokes and thought ‘if I was any of these people I would just kill myself,’ and then realized I was one of them. I mean, honestly, what is the point of a life where you need to sleep 20 hours a day just to feel like shit, where if you talk to anyone honestly about what’s going on with you it’s repellingly depressing, where you seem like you’re just rude and aloof and slow, where you feel like a leper but look like a hungover 24 year old, where you literally feel like you’re dying of aids but you never actually get to die. If i got my dream job i would quit after a week. I need to live in a state of cognitive dissonance and blind optimism just to not jump off a bridge.
I got bloodwork done which found my ANA was elevated, to 1:320 homogenous. I later found out the year before it was tested at 1:160 homogenous but my doctor didn’t bring it up. Now it is 1:1,280 homogenous. I waited months for rheumatology appointments and kept getting passed up to higher and higher people in the rheumatology department. I test positive for SCL70 (scleroderma antibody marker). However, i have none of the skin symptoms or other obvious physical markers of either lupus or scleroderma. Eventually the head of the rheumatology department told me he couldn’t help me, had no idea what was wrong with me, and couldn’t refer me to anyone who might be able to help me.
You have to become a conspiracy theorist to begin to do anything about this disease, you have to become an insane person. You have to read esoteric studies about a 40 year old women who took 20 vitamin c pills every day, you have to experiment on yourself like a mad scientist. You have to read blogs on blogs on journals on essential oil advertisements. There are no real options, so the options you have are laughable. Acupuncture, crystals, nothing is off the table. Most importantly, to do all these things you need to have the energy that you do not have.
I hate the name Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I never tell anyone that’s what I have, because it sounds fucking dumb. Oh you’re tired all the time and can’t figure out why? You’re faking it. Oh there’s a whole bunch of you, huh? Okay, you guys all have Tired All The Time Disease. The main marker for it is that you are tired all the time. Good luck.
I don’t even know if I have CFS, because I don’t think I get worse after I exercise, I feel like I just get worse randomly.
It seems to me there are about ten diseases we have figured out in modern western society, and so if you feel sick and don’t qualify for one of the ten, don’t have iron-deficient anemia or whatever, then you are just one of the invisible thwarted millions that would have benefitted from medicine 500 years from now (if the human race makes it past the next 50.)
So many people will tell you that depression can manifest as other things while ignoring the obvious, that it works the other way around too, that depression is actually a quite reasonable manifestation of having a mysterious, nameless, untreatable, randomly progressing, life-ruining illness. You have to be a fucking robot to not get depressed by this shit.
I thought there was no way anyone could feel like this for this long without dying. I figured I’d drop dead in a couple months and then they’d finally figure out what was wrong with me in the autopsy.
After about 8 months my parents started taking me seriously and my mom found a chronic fatigue specialist, Dr. Roger Mazlen, on Long Island, where I’m from. He ran a bunch of esoteric tests, and told me I have post-viral Syndrome from parvovirus b19, and also told me i was recovering from pancreatitis, and had a mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in my lungs. He was the only doctor who found anything wrong with me but also doesn’t seem entirely with it.
He prescribed me the following supplements: Coq-10, Del-Immune V, Green Tea Extract, RiboGen, Vitamin D, probiotics, Adren-all, pregnenolone, IgG protect powder, Mega Green Tea Extract.
He also prescribed me, temporarily, antibiotics for the mycoplasma pneumoniae and herpes medication, even though I don’t have herpes.
I have the MTHFR gene so I take fish oil and B12 with folinic acid.
I also take NAC. I don’t have the energy to google if things make sense to take, and even if I did there’s deeply contradictory information on basically every supplement in the world, so I’ll just take anything anyone googles and buys for me.
I hate drugs. I hate the idea of needing to rely on chemicals to get through life. I don’t judge anyone and in fact encourage drug use in other people, but thought I would be a more healthy and disciplined person without drugs. I never drank, smoked, never even drank coffee.
everyone in the world was telling me I was just depressed, so I finally started taking antidepressants just to prove to them it wouldn’t fix the problem. They worked, they got rid of my depression and turned me into a completely unfeeling sociopath, and i stopped after a couple months.
I got better than I was, but not better. I got to a point where I could sleep 12 hours a day and be a little slow and out of it but I could fake it, I could bullshit my way through life pretending I was a person. People didn’t think I had taken too many downers all at once anymore, people just thought I was rude and didn’t want to talk.
I finally went back to school after putting my life on hold for a year, not because I felt up to it, but because I knew if i didn’t go back now i never would. I told everyone I was up to it and feeling better, because it made things easier.
I felt, and feel, like a dead man reluctantly doing what he would’ve wanted to do when he was alive. I’m studying creative writing not because it was what I wanted to do but because it’s what I would have wanted to do if I was alive. But that creative part of me, that little demonic spark that could come up with some absurd and disturbing scene that i could write while giggling to myself in instantaneous response to a professor’s random prompt, was gone, is gone. I get brief flashes every now and then, but mostly I feel blank. I am bored by all the tedious, obvious, unoriginal writing I do for in-class creative exercises. I’m doing exactly what I want and I’m hating every second of it. I fucking hate writing now.
But I chugged along, handing in papers on time, saying exactly one thing in every class to keep my participation grade up. And then in May I got worse. I thought I had Mono, or some other virus that other people could handle but my body wouldn’t recover from for months. I was slurring my words, unable to focus my eyes, and people in my dorm were laughing at how drunk I was, but i was sober, and it was 10pm. I walked myself to the emergency room. I thought, this is it. I am ready. I am ready to be taken away. I’m finally acknowledging that this is an emergency, and they’ll see me and they’ll be alarmed and they’ll keep me until they figure out what’s going on. I packed a bag. I planned to be there for weeks, i planned to drop everything and lay myself at their mercy. They ran some basic blood tests that all came back normal, and sent me home at 2am. I kicked a bottle of coke all the way back to my dorm.
You go through life assuming there are all these safety nets behind and under you, in case you fall. You go through life assuming there are all these experts who know more than you, who can figure it out for you when things go really wrong. But when you really need them, when you’re tapping the floor and pulling the cords, when you’re smashing the glass and hitting the big red button, only confetti comes out. You realize it’s an illusion. You realize that unbelievably bad things that can’t be fixed don’t just happen to people for no reason, they happen to YOU for no reason. You begin to wonder how many rugs you’re standing on that can be pulled out from underneath you. And you lose your ability to relate to anyone you know who still lives in that illusory world where things work out for people, and you simultaneously have no desire to associate with anyone who doesn’t live there. You realize you are alone. The idea that something like this just happens to people, lots of people, that your tragedy isn’t even unique or special, is too much to bear, and you can’t stand anyone who is okay with living like this. It’s easier to pretend this isn’t real, this isn’t happening, you’re going to get better, it’ll all go away. It’s easier to lie.
I took extensions, and i used them. I handed in final papers over a month late. I moved into an apartment near campus to take summer classes, like i had planned. I started coughing, nonstop. I remembered I used to cough for months at a time as a kid, and i never went to the doctor. I was getting worse, i was losing my ability to fake it, and i had no idea why, I have no idea why. I dropped all my classes. I’m alone living at a school I’m not attending, riding my bike to restaurants to get job applications then going home and collapsing, knowing i won’t work any job even if i get one, living on a campus of a school I’m not going to, a school all my friends have already graduated from, coughing. I have no reason to be here, or anywhere else. I have nothing to do and nothing I can do if I did. I have no idea what the fuck to do. Help me. Please. Anyone.

If anything feels sketchy then find someone who is a better fit.
In my case the big red flag should have been the fact that she would hand out huge bags if free drug samples to patients like Halloween candy. And when I began having severe side effects and when my mental condition was quickly worsening- she would talk me out of changing the original drugs. Instead she would put me on higher dosages (often the maximum dosage of a given drug). And then she would give me more drugs to fight the side effects, which had side effects of their own which she would prescribe to treat and so on.
Eventually I was on 12 Rx drugs and about 5 or 6 noortropic and misc supplements.
Resulting from this I had a weakened immune system, cysts and lesions on my pancreas, kidneys, ovaries, uterus, and of course, the brain damage.
On the meds I was severely depressed, exhibiting signs of schizoaffective disorder and BPD. Hallucinations, severe short and long term memory loss, severe tremor, severe tics, hair loss, insatiable hunger pangs resulting in obesity, pain and illness from internal organ damage, cluster headaches that would leave me in bed in pain for days, seizures, depression, panic attacks, needing 14+ hours of sleep daily, and more, were just totally normal parts of my life.
It took two psychiatrists and a neurologist sitting me down after a seizure and telling me what was going on and I needed to get away from her. They had all worked with her and pretty much told me I should run.
So I fired her and quit it all. On my own, it was awful from the withdrawals. But I quit them one by one and I noticed myself feeling better with each one I quit.
Turns out most of it was from the meds. The remaining issues were copper toxicity causing hormone related mental illness. So they put me into chemical menopause and the rest is history.

It's never a bad idea to take him to the vet, but this doesn't sound like a serious respiratory issue yet. I have managed to turn rats around at this point, especially when they're young, just by giving extra immune supplements, keeping their environment extra clean and dust free, and feeding well. I like to try this first with mild infections since antibiotics really aren't good for young rats, plus the immunity issues that come from using them too much.

52,2019-08-21 14:37:00,Cbd potentially cancer causing?,"
No problem - I spent some time looking into this because I personally was (and to a degree still am) concerned that there could an inherent carcinogenic effect to marijuana or it's constituents, but it appears that this risk is primarily immunological and so as long as your immune status checks out from my (non medical) opinion the risk is minimal.
A cancer patient taking marijuana should have a White Blood Cell count (with full differentiation of cell types, neutrophils/lymphocytes/eosinophils), and a C Reactive Protein level established BEFORE and AFTER starting a marijuana regimen, to catch any drop in immune status.
In healthy people trying to avoid immunosuppresion increasing their risk of cancer, it's quite a bit more difficult. Ultra low CRP (the indicator of inflammation) levels are not a sign of a problem when the immune system is not actively engaged with a threat. In this case you'd have to get more sophisticated immune testing to attempt to provoke and measure a response. This test is probably not accessible to the general public. So I would err on the side of caution and either not use marijuana heavily for no good reason (i.e purely recreationally), or I would at least take a few supplements that are established as maintaining normal immune function. Garlic is a particularly reliable agent in this regard, stimulating immune activity through multiple vectors while not being too potent. Fresh garlic or specifically Allicin-heavy supplements are best for this purpose, Aged Garlic Extract is more anti-inflammatory which is the opposite of what you'd be looking for.

I had a hammy that had something very similar, poked her cheek with a piece of hay she stole from my guinea pigs, and it formed an abcess that required antibiotics and surgery. Make sure to give your hammy probiotics to replace any of the intestinal flora that the antibiotics kill off. This is a good one , mix half a capsule with a mashed blueberry or sprinkled on veggies they like. DMG is also a really helpful supplement (it boosts the body's immune response to infection), 0.1mL once a day would be the dose for a hamster, its tasteless so it mixes well with food or medicine.

I'll speak from recent experience on how I fared well with Bern since I just recently created an alt to play magic teams (my main account is physical) on adventure modes.
Tank: Neraxis is subpar (or not optimal) , while he can definitely protect your team, most of the time your concern would be the timer and survivability as well, especially in late ch8 stages. Bern already needs A LOT of time to build up his damage, and coupled with ""initial cooldowns"" on all his skills, it's safe to assume that Bern will be slow every starting phase. Although the starting cooldowns can be fixed with perks, you don't want those (and I'll argue that they're better suited for pvp builds) as prioritizing s3 dark, t5 dark, and even t5 light is more beneficial in increasing Bern's raw damage output.
Tldr: Neraxis does NOT addresses/fixes very well the innate slow build up of Bern's kit.

You want to abuse Bern's skills, so it's preferable to pair him up with cooldown reduction units, and Aselica is just a match made in heaven. Aselica wants a BD set and lots of MP/ATK which can be fixed early through weapon runes so you can fire off her s2 before Bern can even cast his s1. Even though Priscilla is a physical unit, the immense cdr she can give to Bern far more outweighs her damage-type incompatibility. Her s3 pull can also make favors for Bern's deceptively-worded ""long/wide-ranged"" skills. Oddy as well (I'm still trying to get him at inn) which is infamous for making Luldia a very broken unit. Lastly if you have no Priscilla or Oddy yet, and really wants to save your rubies and infinity stones/exp pots, Clause will do fine in 80-ish level with t6 ID tank gear selectors you can get from newbie logins. Aselica and Clause's combined stun in both of their first skill provides enough protection, or if Clause is out, Lorraine's CC will also supplement Bern's lack of impactful CC skills. Frey (Balanced) > Rephy (Defensive) > Laias (Incompatible)
If you're just starting out, the natural choice for healer is Frey as Laias is a wasted potential for Bern's no-mana policy, and Rephy is just too defensive when Aselica can also heal a bit and Bern already has innate tankiness from all his DEF buffs too. Frey is balanced in such a way that she provides shield as a very effective damage mitigator and also supplements the downtime of Bern's cc immunity from his s2, while she can also deal a lot of damage from her s3 coupled with some amp and blind. The shield has a decent uptime too when compared to the likes of Loman's shield. Bern may lack some protection on magic side as Aselica only preemptively buffs P. DEF every starting phase (t5 Dark perk) so Frey's shield really helps a lot. I can't stress enough how much important Frey's shield is, especially at latter half of ch8, with those draconic statues and mages hurling and spitting fireballs nonchalantly. The newbie logins and some other sources(?) will give you 2-3 UW selectors, and I find it very economical and efficient to use it on Frey, as having a very stable and strong support right from the start is already a huge boon. Frey also builds ATK stat so her strong shields also equates to decent ATK buffs with her t5 dark perk. This equates to Bern's job needing to be as destructive as possible, which you can only do if you can reduce his cooldowns on a very consistent manner while opting out from his perks that can reduce initial cooldowns in favor of raw damage/amp stats from perks. Make sure you have at least 1-2*UW on Bern and at least 0*UT4 on him so you can breeze ch8 with ease.
Lastly, get Priscilla or Oddy along the way. Annette as well so Bern's s3 skill animation can be reduced a lot, but that's for a bit of mid-game scenario.

DAE have digestive issues like Candida, SIBO and/or Parasites?
I have reoccurring digestive issues such as Candida, SIBO and parasites even though I eat really clean and take the right supplements. I am convinced my body and immune system have become weakened and vulnerable to these conditions due to being under stress. The stress of being abused for so long leading to CPTSD can really put a toll on our body. I think my feeling of being stuck in my trauma manifests in my body where my digestion, parasites, and bad bacteria become stuck in my body. I believe as I continue healing from the trauma and release, my digestive issues will also go away. I live a lot of my days tense and hypervigilant. Anyone else struggle with similar GI issues?

59,2019-08-16 21:49:00,Certain Strains Causing Eczema?,"
Can certain strains of probiotics cause eczema? Anytime I start taking “fancy” multi-strain supplements or yogurt I start to develop eczema. I’ve been looking into this for years and have yet to find a solid explanation. The first and most widely used explanation is that I must be experiencing candida die-off. I was satisfied with that answer for a while because I did experience oral thrush (candida) as a teenager so it made sense that I might still have candida. Yet, as I’ve gotten older I’ve become pretty health conscious and even when I consume zero sugar/processed carbs for months and then start taking high strain probiotics, the eczema still eventually starts up. It’s also relevant that I consistently experienced bad eczema when I was younger but it stopped when I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease and cut out gluten. Can probiotics induce an autoimmune response?
I do not get eczema when I supplement with basic, one strain lactobacillus acidophilus; however, the trade off is that I only experience mediocre benefits. I keep trying “fancy” multi strain probiotics because, although they cause skins issues, I like how my digestion responds.
Any ideas?

60,2019-08-05 16:35:00,Everyone should eventually become vegan,"
Should we reduce our consumption of animal base proteins as a society? Yes. However, everyone going vegan is probably not going to be possible due to health concerns.
The human body is optimized for an omnivorous diet where there is a mix of animal and vegetable products being consumed. Due to this, obtaining the necessary amount of protein and other specific nutrients can be very difficult for people who go fully vegan, to the point of a plethora of individuals having to consume additional supplements as prescribed by a nutritionist or, in a significant amount of cases, having to compromise with vegetarianism due to their bodies going into disarray with vegan diets.
Now, if you live in an area with access to a variety of vegetable products with accessible prices and an ease of obtaining them, plus access to a nutritionist and the necessary supplements then you can definitely have a crack at it. And even with all of those, your body may demand a change in diet after a month or so.
Individuals in food deserts, or those below the poverty line, do not have even near the amount of resources necessary for a vegan diet. An omnivorous diet, be it completely omnivorous or one of the varieties of vegetarianism, is cheaper and generally more effective in filling/fueling an individual for heavy work in less meal time. Furthermore, individuals that are below the poverty line/lower middle class/etc. cannot afford the risks a vegan diet may carry, such as missing work days because of feeling sick while their bodies adjust, the costs of a nutritionist and the added cost of the supplements.
As such, in a world where there is income inequality and also distribution inequality in terms of available foodstuffs, it is incredibly difficult for everyone to go vegan. Add in the health difficulties and the fact that a lot of the foodstuffs that would help create a vegan diet have inflated prices due to being sold as 'fitness products', and it becomes practically impossible.
My sources on this are personal experiences, namely my partner who is completely vegan in lifestyle but has had to adjust her diet back to vegetarian and even pescatarian at times because the vegan diet, even with supplements and a nutritionist to aid her, have sent her immune system into whack and also caused her to get so weak from time to time that she has collapsed when trying to run or do straining physical exercise.

61,2019-08-09 12:06:00,Vitamin D acceptance delayed by Big Pharma following Disinformation Playbook,"
I had to make this as a text post as the button to add a submission statement doesn't appear for me (RES?)
Vitamin D acceptance delayed by Big Pharma following the Disinformation Playbook
Big Pharma and its allies in the U.S. and perhaps also in Europe are opposing major recommendations for increases in vitamin D intakes and higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels [above 30 or 40 ng/ml (75-100 nmol/l)], apparently because such measures can significantly reduce the burden of human disease and, therefore, would reduce income and profit from treating disease. Healthcare in the U.S. now consumes almost 20% of the gross domestic product.
Historically, vitamin D was associated with prevention and cure of rickets and osteomalacia, and later with calcium absorption and bone health. In the past two decades, evidence has accrued showing that higher 25(OH)D serum levels from diet, supplements, and/or solar UVB exposure, are associated and mechanistically linked to better health and longer life expectancy.
In 2009-2010, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) reviewed the evidence regarding vitamin D, and was instructed by the study sponsors, the Food and Drug Agency, the National Institutes of Health, and Health Canada, to use only the evidence from published high-quality vitamin D randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, by that time, such trials had only found benefits for bone health. From these studies it was known that bone health 'normalizes' above 25(OH)D levels of~20 ng/ml (50 nmol/l). However, they also used evidence from purely observational studies to suggest that there were risks associated with vitamin D supplementation that raised serum 25(OH)D levels above 30 ng/ml [Ross, 2011a]. This was the basis for their hypothesis of a U-shaped serum 25(OH)D level vs. health outcome relationship (higher risk for both low and high levels). However, this concern was later shown to be largely unfounded since most of the studies reporting U-shaped risk vs. serum level had no data for subject vitamin D supplementation, or for when it had started, thereby confounding subject stratification [Grant, 2016]. Over the last two decades, evidence has accumulated that UVB exposure and vitamin D have many non-skeletal health benefits, mainly from ecological and observational studies and from mechanistic evidence. Recent evidence has accumulated from vitamin D supplementation studies, especially those showing a correction of deficiency [Martineau, 2016]. Such evidence is now strong for cancer [Moukayed, 2013], [Grant, 2017], [Grant, 2018], [McDonnell, 2018], cardiovascular disease [Zhang, 2017], [Wimalawansa, 2018], respiratory tract infections [Martineau, 2017], all-cause mortality rates [Grant, 2011], [Garland, 2014], [Grant, 2016], [Lindqvist, 2016], and pregnancy and birth outcomes such as preterm birth [McDonnell, 2017], [Wagner, 2018] and as now widely reviewed [e.g. Holick, 2007; Pludowski, 2013; Baggerly, 2015; Grant, 2018; Page, 2018; Sorenson and Grant, 2018].
Recommended vitamin D intakes and optimal 'target' serum 25(OH)D levels have increased since the IOM report. For example, The Endocrine Society subsequently recommended 1000-4000 IU/d (25-100 mcg/d) vitamin D supplement intakes and serum 25(OH)D levels >30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l) for patients with baseline insufficiency [Holick, 2011]. A more recent review of vitamin D supplementation guidelines also recommended >30 ng/ml [Pludowski, 2018]. However, such recommendations may be replaced in the near future by those recommending >40 ng/ml based on studies such as those reported recently for preterm birth [McDonnell, 2017] and breast cancer [McDonnell, 2018]. One reason for the low earlier recommendations was the large underestimate made by the IOM in calculating intakes for the average population, (i.e. in 50% of the population) rather than for 97.5% of the population for whom the recommendations were presumed to be aimed [Veugelers & Ekwaru, 2014].
Of course, Big Pharma and its allies must follow current research findings on vitamin D with trepidation since they also realize that the general public also follows the research and has increased its rates of self-supplementation with > 1000 IU/d vitamin D from 0.2% of the population in 2001-2002 to 18.2% in 2013-2014, and that supplementation with >4000 IU/d has also increased from 0.2% in 2007-2008 to 3.2% in 2013-2014 [Rooney, 2017].
The Big Vitamin D Mistake (2017)
Unfortunately, medicine took a very long time to realize that vitamin D is not simply a vitamin that prevents rickets. For that purpose, 400-600 IU/d may be enough. However, we know today that vitamin D is a powerful nuclear receptor-activating hormone of critical importance, especially to the immune system. With the available data mentioned above, the proposed doses would probably suffice to maintain vitamin D levels around or over 75-100 nmol/L, with practically zero risk of toxicity. Undeniably, further studies are needed to clarify the optimal supplementation of vitamin D, although it is uncertain whether a universal recommended dietary allowance is feasible. Meanwhile, actions are urgently needed to protect the global population from the threats posed by vitamin D deficiency.

Avoiding getting sick or a nasty infection in the first place is a HUGE part of my overall plan.
I'm not suggesting walking around in MOPP gear all the time; I'm suggesting washing your hands, following food safety protocols, treating water, washing your clothes and bedding etc.
Bad cuts and scrapes and puncture wounds are pretty easily avoidable by wearing appropriate PPE. Gloves, work boots, long sleeves and long pants, eye pro, chainsaw chaps, whatever. Won't stop EVERY little knick, but the ones you do get won't turn into septic nightmares.
Nutrition is kind of overlooked too and is pretty vital to the immune system. Vitamin supplements are cheap as shit. Theres no reason NOT to have a couple bottles in your stash.

The races don't have too much of an impact on which school of magic to use they just have a few extra free skill levels when you begin the character.
My magic builds are usually focused on getting max enchanting so I can then get 100% spell cost reduction. Then I usually mix several schools.
Illusion is a really fun school, but needs to be supplemented with something to deal damage when you run into immune enemies like dragons. Conjuration is nice so you can spawn distractions. Restoration is great for any build. Alteration is good if you don't want to use any armor. Destruction is just fun, especially with zero spell cost.

74,2019-10-17 12:55:00,How did you transition away from meats?,"
when I first went vegetarian, I ate a lot of faux meat products like morningstar, gardein, and quorn (amy’s also has a lot of vegetarian frozen meals). as a restaurant server I worked weird hours and late nights so having some vegetarian chicken nuggets that I could just pop in the toaster oven or microwave after work was a godsend. try not to rely on these products too much because they can get kinda pricey but they’re delicious and convenient. I also loveee tofu and chickpeas and they can be subbed for chicken in most recipes. pro tip for cooking tofu would be to press it and put it in a tupperware with marinade (i like teriyaki) when you have time. then when you’re ready to eat it, just cook it on a stove top for a few minutes or bake in the oven. the nice thing about tofu and most plant based protein is that it doesn’t have to be cooked through for a certain amount of time like meat, and you can technically eat it uncooked if you want. mexican food is another great and easy option. I keep soft corn tortillas, vegetarian refried beans or black beans, vegan shredded cheese, and taco sauce in the house so I can easily make vegan bean quesadillas after work. they literally take less than 5 minutes to prep and cook. just make sure if you buy refried beans that they’re vegetarian. like old el paso has cans that are specially marked vegetarian, and most organic refried beans are safe as well. I recommend amy’s refried black beans and daiya shredded pepper jack for this one but you can use any brands you like. I definitely noticed a spike in my energy after going vegetarian. It also helped clear my acne in high school sine i was eating less fatty fried foods and more fruits and veggies. the most noticeable benefit was that I hardly ever get sick anymore so I can say it definitely boosted my immune system. also make sure you take a plant-based b12 vitamin supplement, you can find these at walmart. good luck on your meat-free journey! feel free to pm me if you have any questions.

I’ve been trying to build their immunity with supplements/elderberry for a couple months and so far have had good success.
Oh dear, what supplements are you feeding your kids? And why elderberries?
Also, get the flu shot. If you are actually concerned that your kid may have reactions, talk to a specialist. Immunologist can help your kid.
Also, the flu shot may or may not work, as if I remember right, it's based on predicting the strains for the season. Certain years have better success rates than others. Would you rather your kid, in daycare of all places, to get the nasty strain and end up in the hospital? Or if you have other children, they could pass a strain to other kids, yours or others, and get them sick. Someone along the way could get seriously sick. There are reasons that hospitals have signs deterring guests that express symptoms of the flu to not visit family or friends in the hospital. What may be mild to you, could kill someone else. Hell, it almost killed me. I always get the flu shot, but in 2018 I think it missed a decent chuck of strains. I got hella sick, and wound up with pneumonia from it and other complications. Not a fun few weeks recovering from that shit.
Again, if you have concerns, speak with an immunologist. It would be wise to ask about ingredients people are commonly allergic to, like eggs and shit, that may actually be in the vaccines. Not formaldehyde and the other crap antivaxxers commonly spout. The specialist can test your kids possible allergies to the shot. If there are none, then get it.

82,2019-10-14 16:06:00,Type 1 runs in my family,"
The reason why there's no cure for type 1 diabetes isn't because companies are withholding something, or want to keep the status quo.
The reason is that developing a cure for it is incredibly hard .
That's because it involves two big steps.
First, you need to come up with a way to efficiently grow mature islet cells. Until very recently , this was not possible. Grown beta cells were immature, and produced insulin erratically.
Second, you need to fix the faulty immune system response. If you thought that growing islet cells is hard, well, this one is much harder still. Immunomodulation is already being done for other diseases, and it is a very active area of research. But the focus there lies on other, much more severe diseases. Let's face it, as much as type 1 diabetes sucks, it pales in comparison to, say, MS. Autoimmune hepatitis is another big one. If the immune system kills off beta cells, we can at least supplement with insulin. Not easily, but it is doable. If the immune system kills off liver cells , you need immunosuppressants, and eventually a new liver, or you die. And as much as having to treat T1D with exogenous insulin may suck, immunosuppressants are way worse. This is one reason why doctors don't just go an transplant beta cells into T1s and slap methotrexate on them.
Until the immune system response is fixed, T1D cannot be cured. The next best thing is islet cell encapsulation, which also is an area of active research.
So here's what I think will happen:
Short term, T1D management will move more and more towards closed loop pumps. Pump makers and CGM makers know this. The various cooperation programs are a clear indicator of that. Mid term, once encapsulation is stable, T1D treatment will drastically shift, from exogenous insulin infusions, to regular replenishment of encapsulated beta cells. This will be the status quo until at some point the immune system response can be fixed. But it already counts as a functional cure, since normoglycemia is restored without the patient having to actively manage anything. It is just not restored permanently (that would be a true cure).
If you think that companies are against this because they'll lose revenue, then you drastically overestimate the revenue that comes from T1D treatment. We are a tiny blip. T1D is actually a rare disease. In absolute figures, the main consumers of Humalog and co. are T2s, not T1s. Novo Nordisk is developing a basal insulin that is injected once per week . It is intended for T2s. Not T1s. Also, keep in mind that true cashcows are cancer meds, cardiovascular meds like statins etc.
EDIT: There is also a social component that needs to be factored in. T2D is viewed in society as a lifestyle disease. Of course it isn't always triggered by obesity, sedentary lifestyle etc. But fact is, people associate it with a bad lifestyle. Therefore, there is much less of an incentive to cure it. Also, if it appears in older age, there's a certain acceptance that it is just part of aging. I'm not saying this is okay, just that this is how it is. T1D though, that one hits kids. Hard. The social dynamic here is totally different. Everybody feels sorry for little Laura that has to take shots and landed in the ER because of bad hypos. ""Why did she get this, she's a sweet girl, she didn't deserve this"" etc. Parents of T1 kids are very vocal. Meanwhile, 40-50somethings who get diagnosed with T2D are not treated that way at all . People just tell them to lose weight and hit the gym. Which one is backed more by strong emotions?

it's usually easier to treat osteoarthritis with losing weight, joint replacement and anti inflamatories.
Yes, a lot of people could reduce their pain by losing weight. But this is notoriously difficult; very few people manage to lose a significant amount of weight and keep it off long-term. So few that there's a National Weight Control Registry that investigates how such people manage to do it.
And not everybody needs to lose weight. I'm slightly underweight, I have severe osteoarthritis - no cartilage left - in one knee from an old injury. And surprisingly little pain from it.
There is almost nothing that doctors can offer to slow down the joint degeneration from osteoarthritis, other than telling people to lose weight, ""don't run on it"", etc. And iffy things like omega-3 supplements or glucosamin/chondroitin. Whereas with autoimmune arthritis, people can take drugs to decrease the autoimmune reaction. In that sense, it's more treatable.
Joint replacement is a ""cure"", sure, but presumably joints could be replaced in other kinds of arthritis as well. Just chop out the problem.

This is a perfect example of making sure to start and keep up with your skin regimen. Once you hit 30, that’s when you really need to think about bone/immune/brain supplements, SPF30 or higher, retinol for day and night, vitamin c serums, and a lot of anti wrinkle creams. Even a balanced diet is helpful, and lot and lots and lots of hydration.
You can’t just ignore all of these and think enhancements such as fillers/Botox will save you, which I think the Silva twins just ran towards.

Is anybody else in the UK sick and tired of how the NHS pretends that Lyme disease doesn't exist? My GP basically refuses to engage with me at all on the subject anymore and won't even help me get my bloods done every 7 weeks so that I can ensure for my private consultant that my liver hasn't collapsed from the ton of ABX that I am taking everyday. A few years ago, before I was diagnosed with Lyme I was sent to the Pontefract hospital in Wakefield with an extreme headache that my GP thought was a bleed on the brain. I had a doctor that night, about 3 in the morning, wake me up from my snooze on a gurney in the corridor where I had been left all day and night, mock me for about 15 minutes for ""wasting the NHS time and resource with a simple headache"" and then offer me ""If I give you two paracetomol will you go home to your mommy?"". I am 53! Totally disgusting behaviour. If they spent more time on diagnosing and less time in mocking then they might have found the cause before it became chronic.
Disgusting behaviour all round.
After that rant some history. I contracted Lyme in Saudi in 2013. Undiagnosed until 2016. I have been receiving private treatment since 2016 with transient results ( get better only to succumb again 6 to 18 months later). I am currently on Doxy, Azithomycine, Rifampicin and Hydroxychloroquine as well as a raft of supplements to try and boost my immune system. Current results are positive and I will be starting on Disulfiram in December to (hopefully) nail this condition once and for all.

Good luck all.

Title: My psychiatrist cancelled my prescription because of a Negative result from a pee test. But I take it religiously everyday.
Original Post:
I kind of rely on my medication ""Concerta"". I take the middle mg dose of the available 3. I only take it once a day. It's a big quality of life issue for me. O become lethargic, anxious, and unfocused without it, and feel like a normal person on it. I've been taking it everyday for a year and a half now, religiously everyday at 2 pm. I have a phone reminder set daily, I've left places early in order to take it in time, etc. It's a big deal to me.
This past visit, she urine tested me for the first time. I was confused so I asked her about it. She said they want to make sure I'm not taking any other amphetamine on top of it or anything that might affect my health. I assured her I didn't. I don't do anything except vape 3mg nicotine, and smoke marijuana (which she knows and says she doesn't care about. Something about it being legal in half the states, so she doesn't really put stock in the illegality of our state). I don't even drink.
They call me the next day and said the Dr. Has cancelled the order due to no Concerta showing up in the urine. How is this possible? I was taking a zinc supplement for immune help (I get sick this time every year, changing seasons). I drink a ton of water daily (kidney stone prevention).
I called the office and tried my best to get in touch with my Dr. First on Monday when I got the call, then today. They keep telling me they're passing thr message along and the doctor will return my call. Well she hasn't.
I feel like my quality of life has been flippantly ripped away and have little to no recourse. Am I correct??

My child is 5 and I’m pro vaccination.
But when it comes to the flu shot, I freeze up, my mind goes crazy with mixed thoughts and feelings about the flu shot. Why? Because I’m the crazy person who believes that one good way to kill us off is to put it in the flu shot! I’m afraid of side effects, I’m afraid of the horror stories of the flu shot that you hear.
My child had the flu shot when they was first born in October. Since then, I’ve never done it again. The year they started daycare at 3 years, they got the flu but a very mild flu of maybe two days. Last year they got the flu and it was awful! A whole week of illness and fluctuating fever. It was scary and I even said the flu shot would be worth it next year.
Well here we are now and I’m so torn on what to do. You’re probably thinking “really?!” I’ve been trying to build their immunity with supplements/elderberry for a couple months and so far have had good success. But the flu shot keeps lingering in the back of my mind. I’m an anxious person so it’s harder for me to have a clear mind for rational decision making when I have scary, irrational thoughts bombarding me constantly.

Take creatine daily, not just post workout. Put the amounts of everything you take. I find creatine stimulating so I can't take it past 5 pm for a 10 pm bedtime. Caffeine also interferes with my sleep cycle no matter what so I cut it to 0. Just do low intensity exercise. Try the sauna. There's a supplement called Beta glucan that helps preserve immune function under stress, 500 mg ish of the 1/3 type I believe per day.

A wide body of research on the impact of oral creatine use on exercise has produced mixed results. Oral creatine use might benefit athletes who require short bursts of energy, such as sprinters and weight lifters.
Anecdotal, but I supplemented with it for around 4-months during a bulking phase and didn't even get an appreciable placebo effect.
There is concern that long-term use of creatine at high doses could damage the liver, kidneys or heart.

Pro tips:
Leave injection pen out for an hour before taking, when it's room temperature the pain is cut in half. Since you can inject into the abdomen, find some soft, jiggly skin that isn't too close to your belly button, enough to where you can grab it and bunch it up into a flab/flap, and inject into the top of it. (You don't want the stuff going into a muscle) It makes it so you don't feel the needle at all, only the medicine going in. Talk to your primary doc about some vitamins/ supplements for your immune system!!! Taltz is super strong and you don't want a common cold getting you down for a month! Good luck :- )

Some context: creatine is already known to act as a molecular battery in muscle tissue, in fact IIRC “molecular battery” is the term my physiology prof used. It does this by storing an activated phosphate group:
creatine + ATP <—> phosphocreatine + ADP
So this isn’t hugely surprising — it just shows that immune cells can also use creatine the way muscles do.

A virus that's more transmissible than the (flu which was clinically proven to not be stopped by masks) won't be stopped by masks.
Eating healthy, keeping active, getting sunlight exposure are all things that boost your immune system. Zinc supplements help so much because it greatly helps the immune system.
Masks are bullshit, experimental vaccines are bullshit. Eat fruit for once in your life and go outside instead of living on reddit and you'll be just fine."
107,2021-04-30 22:30:00,Each specialty has their own approach to managing shoulder pain. [meme],I heard about a chiropractor in my area pressing someone’s groin to see if they “had COVID”. Also said that a set of supplements gives you immunity against the virus too.
108,2021-04-03 04:21:00,"Fully vaccinated Americans can travel within the US without testing or quarantine, according to new CDC guidelines","Antibodies take time to recognize the invader. Your immune system uses markers to track infected cells/invaders that are then destroyed by antibodies later which can vary from a couple hours to a couple days. It's not an automatic system. The virus still has time to replicate.
A vaccine also doesn't make you immune either in a sense that you can just forego caution. That is an exaggeration and an oversimplification. You can still get sick with a disease your vaccinated for, you just might be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. The point of a vaccine to to keep you from dying and to supplement your immune system.
Also no one knows how long this particular vaccine lasts. You could be safer for 90 days or 90 years. So that's also a concern. Even people who have been infected and became well again can get infected immediately after getting better. There's also multiple strains. Some of the COVID vaccines are more effective against the US strain then the UK one and vice versa. And god forbid everyone who's vaccinated stops wearing masks that can lead an increase of different strain.
I'm not trying to fear monger but even the CDC says to exercise caution until a majority of the population is vaccinated."
109,2021-04-25 13:43:00,"People who hate lockdowns, What's your solution then? :","Everyone talks about masks and social distancing. How come no one in media or government or health professionals talk about boosting your immune system. I bought an air plane ticket for my mother and grandmother to visit me from Ottawa, they both took the vaccine but when they come back they would have to still get tested and quarantine them selves at their own expanse at a designated hotel...
I'm not saying that anyone's immune system will take care of the virus but if everyone were to supplement by boosting your immune system to optimal levels then you would be less likely to get infected in the first place. Of course if you wear a mask in public, if exposed to the virus will give you a significantly smaller dose which will give your immune system a better fighting chance then without the mask. Go and watch the Korean director of viral infections on YouTube. In the interview, the question was asked - is there a cure and he responded by saying, ""as of right now there is no cure for the virus and the only thing that fights it is your own immune system.
I personally, take my vitamin a,b,c,d,e,k daily and based on my body weight take almost a kilogram of Vitamin C in ascorbic acid per month + 10 times the daily prescribed dose of vitamin D. I know that vitamins taken with minerals double or tripplle the effect. So vitamin C + niacin+ zinc and Vitamin D + calcium + magnesium doubles and tripples the absorption effect.
I've also started taking Chaga mushroom daily which works with vitamin C. When you take vitamin C, it's only in your body for one hour. Taking Chaga, helps storing vitamin C longer in your body. Chaga is the most anti viral substance on the planet and naturally fights pneumonia.
Some people would say that they don't need to suppliment because they eat and live healthy but i think that it's not enough to keep your immune system at optimal levels to prevent your self from the virus if exposed. 1 gram of vitamin C is equivalent to 6 oranges. Daily dose of vitamin D is being exposed to the sun shirtless for one hour daily.
I'll share my results from supplimenting with vitamins for over a year now.
I sleep like a baby, wake up feeling refreshed, don't even have the need to press the snooze button. I have more energy throughout the day and for the first time in my life broke the cycle of having annual cold sores.
Every year since I was 5, I would get one cold sore per year.. Ever since I moved to Calgary 6 years ago,( I'm guessing because of the climate ) I would get them 3 times a year. After taking the responsibility to boost my immune system, I feel healthier than ever and haven't had a cold sore since.
Shutting down the economy is not the solution to the problem. People will suffer more psychologicaly and financially from isolation and lockdows than the virus itself..
Don't even get me started about the mRNA products that is in fact an experimental vaccine. Studies are showing birth defects and infertilities. There are reports of women having abnormally painful periods. Also women in their menopause having periods again. There are also reports of people getting infected even if they are vaccinated. If it took them over 70 years on research and development to get a 40% efficiency rate for influenza, I'm skeptical about them having 90%+ efficiency for covid that only took one year to develop. There is currently no vaccine for Sars, MERS or HIV virus which is present in covid19 as inclusions. I'm not an anti vaxer but at the same time I refuse to be the experiential guiny pig for this mRNA product. This is the first vaccine in history to use such technology. FDA did not even approve of it but only authorized it for emergency use. Pfizer CEO now publicly stated that you need a 3rd shot, and now annual shots to be fully immune yet the government wants to release passports based on who's vaccinated or not....
Make your own conclusions, do your own homework. I'm not saying I'm right or wrong. This is only my opinion from doing my personal research on the subject.

I think there are two variables that we can control to mitigate getting infected. First is viral load and second is the individual immune response. It's very likely that most of us already got the virus but just don't know it. The PCR tests, at least those ones used in PGH, only has a peak sensitivity 80% after the first week of infection. That suggests to me that our body can be considered negative of the virus provided the viral load is below a certain threshold. It also means quality of exposure and duration is a big factor with regards to viral load. We're already trying to mitigate those with social distancing, hand sanitizing and PPEs.
The second variable is not often talked about, our individual immune responses. If we assume everyone has or will get infected, I think we can increase our chances by boosting our immune system. I've read some good things about Vitamin D3 and Zinc supplements. It might not be specific protection against this particular virus, but might help boost our system in general. I think it might be worthwhile to spend some money on good quality supplements in addition to PPEs and social strategies."

In the case of autoimmune issues, sometimes simple protocols that can include supplements and other the counter medications which carry little risks can make a difference. The testing for it can prove to be helpful for many people, particularly if a diagnosis is made and because it is mostly bloodwork it is not a significant burden on you. Find someone that is willing to work with your RE to fine tune the protocols if treatments are recommended to ensure smooth cycle.
The workup for endometriosis is also something to consider but discuss with your RE the option of surgery vs treating it empirically. Weigh the risks vs benefits to determine what makes most sense both from the perspective of time and cost.
Also discuss with your doctor considering a hysteroscopy, if you haven’t had one in the six months prior the transfers. Sometimes even microscopic changes to the endometrium can promote implantation."

A cat's claw supplement was the culprit. I just wanted a boost in my immune system and joint health. It was not fun.

Why in the actual f*** are experimental vaccines being pushed for them besides pure disgusting...,"Not enough is known about variants though - they're already suggesting we have to keep taking the vaccines (really they should be called shots like we do for the flu shot) year after year. This is why countries like Australia are already saying even if everyone is vaccinated, they're still not going to open the country for international travellers .
I agree with you that we don't know enough about Covid's long-term effects, but in equal measure we don't know the long-term effects of these shots/vaccines.
I've advocated for over a year now that people need to work on boosting their immune systems via good nutrition (very much including vitamin D supplementation) and exercise. I'm not saying that's some cure-all, but it certainly helps."
125,2021-04-09 15:19:00,MIL wants me to bottle feed so she can keep my 2 month old for long periods of time,"MIL is ridiculous. Overnights with babies are only because the parent needs/wants them. The baby doesn't benefit. My kid loves overnights with his grandparents, but that is something that came later.
MIL does not get a say in how your child is fed. That's a discussion that involves you, LO's dad, and the pediatrician/other medical care. No other parties get any input. And frankly you get the most say, because you are the one breastfeeding here - for example dad or the doctor can't say you have to breastfeed.
I think you might want to rethink how you think of formula fed babies. (Please note: I breastfed my son for 2.5 years. We needed to supplement formula the first three weeks as per lactation consultant and pediatrician, but after that he had exclusive breastmilk for the first 6 months until we added solids. I pumped at work from 5 months to 15 months. I'm pretty pro-breastfeeding, but I'm more pro-parents doing what they need and want as long as their child is getting proper care.) I know you were trying to say that your MIL is used to moms formula feeding so they can party, but there are a lot of other good reasons to formula or combination feed (by choice of by necessity.) This is not really about your MIL, but you might want to be careful about how you come across there.
You and your SO need to get on the same page as to MIL and babysitting if you aren't already. You two should be on the same side and have a plan to communicate with MIL. On your end, I'd just cheerfully say, ""We're fine,"" or ""I got it."" I'd leave the more serious talks to your SO.
There is a huge lack of information about breastfeeding here:
*A bottle in the middle of the night might not actually help you sleep better. At 2 months, I would have had to get up and pump anyway, because I needed to keep my supply up. Later I would have needed to get up and pump, because full boobs. Nursing is way, way, way easier than pumping. Also pumping sucks. And you have to wash parts. Now it may work for some people, but it would for many at that point.
*If you were sick you should breastfeed or at least pump. It keeps your supply stable and gives baby your immunity. If you weren't getting enough milk, you could supplement with formula then.
Now, having nothing to do with your MIL, once breastfeeding is well-established, I personally think it is a good idea to pump a small freezer stash to have on hand if something come up or as a starter amount for if/when you go back to work. Personally for me, pumping was very ineffective until breastfeeding was going well which was about four months. And then it wasn't fun or easy. When I was getting closer to going back to work, I started having my husband do a bottle feed once a day (to get baby used to that) while I pumped enough for the next night's bottle and then a little extra to save. It worked out well and my husband enjoyed feeding baby.
Also, some babies have difficulty taking a bottle. I think it would be a good idea to expose baby to a bottle at least every so often once breastfeeding is established in case it is needed. Maybe when baby is 3 months old, you and your husband want to go out to a short lunch while your friend babysits. Or maybe there is an emergency. Anyway, my unsolicited breastfeeding feedback is when you feel settled pump a little bit (I think a day's milk frozen would be plenty and that would take awhile to do) in addition to feeding."
126,2021-04-17 15:39:00,Daily Discussion Thread: 04/16/2021,"Hello All! FNG here. And, I cleared w/the Mods before posting this.
Background: I am looking into supplements.
It actually all started with chasing a thread regarding the benefits of Vitamin D3 against COVID-related complications, etc. By the time I had gathered information on D2 & D3, I was looking at an entire regime of vitamins (A, C, E, Magnesium, Calcium, Cod Liver Oil, etc.), in a slew of individual containers from an array of manufacturers. Rabbit hole goes deep quick! I thought to myself, there must be a pre-packed vitamin set I can take? So I searched for vitamin packs and was presented with Animal among others.
So in the interest of not becoming a TLDR post: BLUF: Thoughts on Animal supplement products? Specifically: PAK, Immune PAK, FLEX, & OMEGA.
Do you use? Are there better products? Is Animal garbage? Should I pursue individual vitamins by type or other quantity such as IU? What supplements do you use and why you consider the product you use better? Any other guidance or advice.
Thanks in advance for your time and responses. And thanks to Mods for letting me post this!"
127,2021-04-02 00:10:00,I am looking for a human host??? : nosleep,"Are you bored? Are you lonely and bored? Do you have a lot of time on your hands? Do you have hands?
I’m offering you a proposal, with potential financial compensation for your troubles. It may sound off putting at first blush, but hear me out. I am looking for a human host. And I mean a “willing” human host who might be willing to give up some of their time to help out an odd fellow that doesn’t have hands or blood.
Am I asking to control your body? Yes. Sometimes. You’ll still be there, but taking the backseat. Now you’re probably thinking “That sounds no fun! I don’t want to spend all my time riding shotgun.” And that’s valid. But you all spend about half of the day unconscious anyway. Your body is just there, doing nothing—a complete waste. As for me, I don’t sleep (haha), so we could have it so that during the day, I will graciously let you do fun human things, and at night, I’ll do whatever.
And by whatever, I mean perfectly safe, perfectly reasonable activities. I don’t drink, and I rarely go outside. I enjoy baking, I look at pictures of birds online, I’ve been getting into neuroscience lately. Very interesting stuff. You’re all very interesting.
And maybe you’re still thinking “Hey now, I don’t want some random mind-controlling thingy hauling my body around in my sleep, “Weekend at Bernie’s Style”” to which I say, you’re no fun and you’re not the kind of person I want to live with anyway.
“But I’m a light sleeper!” you say. Don’t worry! I can isolate your somatosensory cortex so you can’t feel anything.
“But my family will think it’s weird!” you say. Don’t worry! You don’t have to tell them.
Actually, I would prefer that you don’t tell anyone. Please.
And should anyone question me, I’m not bad at impressions. I’ll get really good at a “you” impression, it’ll be the first thing I do!
I know this all sounds very strange and potentially unpleasant, but remember the financial compensation that may or may not be happening. Hell, I’ll even do some of your chores if you like, while you sleep. You can wake up and the dishes will be done, laundry folded and coffee made. Doesn’t that sound nice? And then you open the fridge and oh, what’s this? Someone baked banana bread last night (that was me, I baked banana bread last night.)
Now I should say, I don’t have a lot of standards, I really don’t. But I do (unfortunately) have some, so let’s just get them out of the way before I waste your time.
Please do not contact me if you have any of the following:
- Anemia : Sorry, it’s just not going to work out. I can pay for iron supplements, but I can’t work miracles.
- A weak immune system : I don’t like getting sick, I’m sorry. It’s gross, sick people are gross. I mean I know it’s not your fault, but healthy folks only please.
- A strong immune system : Yes, I know what I just said, but I also don’t want to be attacked by your immune system. So maybe you’re not the picture of health, but you’re just kind of okay. I’m looking for someone who is just kind of okay.
- A penchant for alcohol : It makes me feel strange…
- A name that starts with a P : I’m not the greatest at “speaking.” It’s hard, moving air through your throat and moving your tongue and your mouth at the same time. You all do it so easy—can’t say I’m not envious! I’m the worst at making the “P” sound. I intentionally avoid any ""p word"" in conversation, and get by well enough, but I’ll look pretty foolish if I’m cavorting about, pretending to be you, and I can’t even say your own name!
Those are my standards, but really, other than that, I’ll take anyone.
I don’t care if you’re male or female or whatever.
I don’t care if you’re gay.
I don’t care if you’re smart.
I don’t care if you don’t have a lawyer.
There are so many things that I don’t care about.
Now, I’ve specified all the ways in which I could compensate you and how our relationship will be not in any way problematic, but I want to stress that, above all things, I am looking for a friend. Someone I can spend quiet evenings with.
If you want to hang out with me during the day, that’s great! I can give you fun hallucinations. Or you could have hallucinations the normal way, like by reading, like what you’re doing now. I love to read! I love doing funny voices. I wonder what you think I sound like? I hope I sound nice.
And one of the best things about me is I’m very quiet. No one else will be able to hear me except you. I’ll be like your own personal friend that only you know. Like a secret friend. And you don’t even have to talk to me because I can read your thoughts.
I suppose I should tell you a bit more about myself, since you’re still reading.
I was born in the Everglades, I think. It’s been awhile. But I remember being so cold… And so alone...
But then I met this sweaty man in a colorful tee-shirt, with a camera, and half a granola bar, and with blood so hot.
So yeah, he was my first host, and I’ll admit, we weren’t the best of friends. It was a confusing time for both of us. I was confused. He was confused. What happened was really both of our faults, you could say…
He was a bird watcher, if I recall correctly. Just watched birds all the time. I thought it might have been out of jealousy—watching those little things flying around makes you feel kind of stuck. I felt stuck.
So I decided to be a bird for a while to see if it was really all it’s cracked up to be. Squished myself into the body of this lovely American crow. We settled down, built a nest, and laid several nice, healthy eggs with a man-bird by the name of “Richard Baxter.” He was a very proud bird, very large. And he gave me so many wonderful gifts. Like children, and also small pieces of plastic.
I still have all of them. The plastic, not the children.
I’d never been so happy, all these hormones had me consumed in the joy of motherhood, but the crow’s health was failing. I could not sustain myself—it’s pathetic little heart beat weaker and weaker. I tried starving, I tried everything I could, I wanted to be a bird so bad. But it just wasn’t working out. The bird stopped working. The other crows held a funeral service for me, even though I was still alive. I tried to tell them, but I’m not good at speaking, you remember. It was all just a big mess.
I haven't seen Baxter since, but I still think about him a lot. Is that weird?
I’m totally over it though, haha.
After that incident, I got kind of depressed...but I was too much of a coward to do much about it. I possessed a lot of trash animals—gulls, racoons, and salespeople. I did what I could to survive.
That’s kind of where I am now.
I am currently living in Miami florida—been body surfing almost every day (haha). Right now I’m using a library computer and a librarian. She does not like being possessed, boy howdy are these fingers twitching. But you can thank her for my halfway decent grammar.
I’m tired of feeling like a parasite. I want to try a different approach. I want to be friends? Like with Richard Baxter except I also live in your brain and drink your blood sometimes. But I’ll make you bread in your sleep, so it’s okay. It’s been really hard finding someone willing to put up with me. I’ve tried everything.
So I thought I would put up an advertisement online, why not? Can’t say the P word in real life, but you can hear it in your head loud enough I hope.
I know I kept saying that I would compensate you financially, but I’m going to be real with you, I don’t have much. I’ve got like twenty bucks, some small pieces of plastic and a book about...finance....
But I’m a real hoot! ;D So, (P)lease, If you are interested, leave your comments below. I would love to get to know you :) I need to go now, the library is closing soon, but I’ll get back as soon as I can.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/cdc-safe-to-take-tylenol-or-otc-pain-medications-after-covid-vaccine.html
The Centers for Disease Control says that you can take over-the-counter pain medicine, such as ibuprofen (like Advil), aspirin, antihistamines or acetaminophen (like Tylenol), if you have side effects after getting vaccinated for Covid.
https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20210218/take-a-painkiller-before-your-covid-vaccine
Although the odds of a diminished immune response aren't really known, Poland said it's better to suffer the side effects than take the chance of making the vaccine less effective.
""After receiving the vaccine, if one develops symptoms that they feel they want to treat, it's fine, but ideally not before,"" he said. ""Now, that's a recommendation by CDC, out of an abundance of caution.""
""Go ahead and take it rather than end up with a full-blown migraine and end up in the ER having to get much more intensive or expensive therapy,"" Poland said.
""The symptoms are transient, they're self-resolving, they are not an indication that something's going wrong,"" he said. ""If need be, go ahead and treat them.""
""My general belief on this is it's never a good idea to blunt fever, because fever is an adaptive part of your immune response,"" he said.
""Let your immune system do its job,"" Offit said. ""The second dose was pretty rough. I had fatigue and fever, but I handled it by whining. Whining was my way of handling it.""
https://www.prevention.com/health/a35382367/tylenol-ibuprofen-after-covid-19-vaccine/
Data doesn’t definitively say that taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen after getting vaccinated will interfere with the vaccine’s effectiveness, so don’t stress over it too much
If you have bothersome pain or discomfort, taking an OTC med, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, per the dosage instructions is reasonable
“It’s a risk/benefit decision that is unique to each patient,” says Alan. “If someone has a fever of 104, it might be worth taking a dose of either acetaminophen or ibuprofen,” she says.
If you’re uncomfortable but feel like you can ride things out, Dr. Schaffner recommends drinking plenty of fluids, getting rest, and, if you have a fever, dressing in light clothes. If you feel soreness at the injection site, apply a cool, clean, wet washcloth to reduce swelling and try to move your arm gently to give it mild exercise, per the CDC.
https://slate.com/technology/2021/04/should-i-take-tylenol-after-my-covid-shot-can-i-drink.html
“All these side effects you get are basically a reaction to your immune response turning on, so it doesn’t seem like a good idea to take something that blocks that,” says Roper.
Rather, all this advice centers around putting your immune system’s best foot forward
Stay hydrated and eat well, of course, but there’s no need to go out of the way to drink a ton of water or vitamin C supplements; neither has any particular effect on your immune system. Perhaps one upside of prescribing this kind of routine to patients is a type of placebo effect—it makes people feel like they’re prepared, and can reduce anxiety about going to their appointment."

Whether or not you decide to stay vegan, even if it's against your ethical code, your well-being matters. A lot of vegans seem forget that being cruel to other people or themselves is still a form of animal cruelty.
Personally, I've been there too. I've gone back and forth between plant based and vegetarian for the last 10 years, even though ethically I've always been confident that I should be eating plant based. Over the years, it's been easier and easier for me to go plant based, and I've learned a lot about what does and doesn't work for me. Even when not fully removing eggs or dairy from my meals, it's still progress towards that goal of mine. I've also realized that when I get tempted to stray from plant based foods, sometimes just adding some vegan processed foods hit the spot and keep me on track. Perfect is the enemy of good, as they say.
The vegan community often pushes a lot of very unsustainable and unhealthy dietary information out there, that really isn't well balanced. It can sound great, but not actually be healthy or adapted for you specifically. I really suggest trying out chronometer to see how well balanced your foods might be. When I started using that site, I realized that I was completely missing certain vitamins in my regular vegan days, and I started realizing that certain macro balances made me feel more satisfied and healthy. You have to really eat a fairly stable diet for a few weeks at a time to really understand the impact your diet has.
Do you take any supplements? It's critically important to take a proper amount of b12 as a vegan, and Vitamin D3 and long-chain omega 3's (EPA / DHA) are really a great idea as well. Deficiency any of those can have really sneaky side effects that are really hard to see at times, but make a huge difference to your health. Omega 3's are typically why a lot of ex vegans eat fish, and B12 and vitamin D are in dairy and eggs, but there are perfectly fine supplements as well.
If you're having auto immune issues, there's a number of dietary changes worth trying that might help. Personally, I've known a few people who went plant based specifically to treat their auto immune issues with great success. People tend to do elimination diets to remove potentially triggering foods like nightshades, rather than adding foods. I also thought eggs and dairy were normally auto immune trigger foods, and have always heard that they were some of the first foods removed with the elimination diets. I've personally had bad luck with nutritionists and doctors telling me to add eggs and dairy to my diet, which infuriated me because I was there to talk about gallstones . I was told if I ate high fat foods, I'd be hospitalized for emergency surgery, and then told by my doctor to add eggs and cheese! I found a new doctor, and things were way better. If your doctors are suggesting eggs and dairy, they should be able to tell you why, and give you a medical justification for it, not just an ""I think it will help"". Self advocacy can be critical in getting better medical care.
In my opinion, I would suggest trying to find a plant based doctor or professional . Nutrition can't solve all problems, but finding someone who is specifically trained in understanding how your eating will impact your health could help you make progress towards your medical concerns without needing you to compromise your ethics. Not all doctors are equal, and sometimes you have to fight a bit to find the care that helps you live your best life.
That said, it's better to be forgiving and kind to yourself as a vegetarian than be a vegan because you hate yourself. Even if you have no justification for why you add eggs and dairy besides you want to, that isn't a judgement of your character. Love and compassion are the best drivers of positive change, and they can guide your decisions a lot better than any kind of negativity."

Try to drink as much water as you (reasonably) can. Our bodies are about 75% water so be sure to drink plenty to ensure optimal brain and body function.
When it comes to food, eat a reasonable amount of lean, unprocessed meats unless you have some sort of dietary restriction (vegetarian, vegan, etc). Try to eat one helping of vegetables per meal and have 1-2 servings of fruit per day.
When it comes to supplements, unless you feel like your deficient in something or feel ‘slightly off’, I would recommend something like a daily multivitamin and maybe a vitamin C or Vitamin D supplement on top of that for immune system health. Also feel free to get blood work done at a doctor and get their opinion on additional supplements if necessary.
You can have sweets and chips and things, but I would say have them sparingly.
Lastly, I would say get a mentally-engaging but stress-relieving hobby. For some it’s video games, for some it’s reading, for some it’s working out. Every one has a different way of relieving stress and anxiety. Ultimately if you can find something like that to help keep you from getting overwhelmed and anxious in life, you will have a much better time physically and mentally than someone struggling with anxiety and stress.

I’m offering you a proposal, with potential financial compensation for your troubles. It may sound off putting at first blush, but hear me out. I am looking for a human host. And I mean a “willing” human host who might be willing to give up some of their time to help out an odd fellow that doesn’t have hands or blood.
Am I asking to control your body? Yes. Sometimes. You’ll still be there, but taking the backseat. Now you’re probably thinking “That sounds no fun! I don’t want to spend all my time riding shotgun.” And that’s valid. But you all spend about half of the day unconscious anyway. Your body is just there, doing nothing—a complete waste. As for me, I don’t sleep (haha), so we could have it so that during the day, I will graciously let you do fun human things, and at night, I’ll do whatever.
And by whatever, I mean perfectly safe, perfectly reasonable activities. I don’t drink, and I rarely go outside. I enjoy baking, I look at pictures of birds online, I’ve been getting into neuroscience lately. Very interesting stuff. You’re all very interesting.
And maybe you’re still thinking “Hey now, I don’t want some random mind-controlling thingy hauling my body around in my sleep, “Weekend at Bernie’s Style”” to which I say, you’re no fun and you’re not the kind of person I want to live with anyway.
“But I’m a light sleeper!” you say. Don’t worry! I can isolate your somatosensory cortex so you can’t feel anything.
“But my family will think it’s weird!” you say. Don’t worry! You don’t have to tell them.
Actually, I would prefer that you don’t tell anyone. Please.
And should anyone question me, I’m not bad at impressions. I’ll get really good at a “you” impression, it’ll be the first thing I do!
I know this all sounds very strange and potentially unpleasant, but remember the financial compensation that may or may not be happening. Hell, I’ll even do some of your chores if you like, while you sleep. You can wake up and the dishes will be done, laundry folded and coffee made. Doesn’t that sound nice? And then you open the fridge and oh, what’s this? Someone baked banana bread last night (that was me, I baked banana bread last night.)
Now I should say, I don’t have a lot of standards, I really don’t. But I do (unfortunately) have some, so let’s just get them out of the way before I waste your time.
Please do not contact me if you have any of the following:
- Anemia : Sorry, it’s just not going to work out. I can pay for iron supplements, but I can’t work miracles.
- A weak immune system : I don’t like getting sick, I’m sorry. It’s gross, sick people are gross. I mean I know it’s not your fault, but healthy folks only please.
- A strong immune system : Yes, I know what I just said, but I also don’t want to be attacked by your immune system. So maybe you’re not the picture of health, but you’re just kind of okay. I’m looking for someone who is just kind of okay.
- A penchant for alcohol : It makes me feel strange…
- A name that starts with a P : I’m not the greatest at “speaking.” It’s hard, moving air through your throat and moving your tongue and your mouth at the same time. You all do it so easy—can’t say I’m not envious! I’m the worst at making the “P” sound. I intentionally avoid any ""p word"" in conversation, and get by well enough, but I’ll look pretty foolish if I’m cavorting about, pretending to be you, and I can’t even say your own name!
Those are my standards, but really, other than that, I’ll take anyone.
I don’t care if you’re male or female or whatever.
I don’t care if you’re gay.
I don’t care if you’re smart.
I don’t care if you don’t have a lawyer.
There are so many things that I don’t care about.
Now, I’ve specified all the ways in which I could compensate you and how our relationship will be not in any way problematic, but I want to stress that, above all things, I am looking for a friend. Someone I can spend quiet evenings with.
If you want to hang out with me during the day, that’s great! I can give you fun hallucinations. Or you could have hallucinations the normal way, like by reading, like what you’re doing now. I love to read! I love doing funny voices. I wonder what you think I sound like? I hope I sound nice.
And one of the best things about me is I’m very quiet. No one else will be able to hear me except you. I’ll be like your own personal friend that only you know. Like a secret friend. And you don’t even have to talk to me because I can read your thoughts.
I suppose I should tell you a bit more about myself, since you’re still reading.
I was born in the Everglades, I think. It’s been awhile. But I remember being so cold… And so alone...
But then I met this sweaty man in a colorful tee-shirt, with a camera, and half a granola bar, and with blood so hot.
So yeah, he was my first host, and I’ll admit, we weren’t the best of friends. It was a confusing time for both of us. I was confused. He was confused. What happened was really both of our faults, you could say…
He was a bird watcher, if I recall correctly. Just watched birds all the time. I thought it might have been out of jealousy—watching those little things flying around makes you feel kind of stuck. I felt stuck.
So I decided to be a bird for a while to see if it was really all it’s cracked up to be. Squished myself into the body of this lovely American crow. We settled down, built a nest, and laid several nice, healthy eggs with a man-bird by the name of “Richard Baxter.” He was a very proud bird, very large. And he gave me so many wonderful gifts. Like children, and also small pieces of plastic.
I still have all of them. The plastic, not the children.
I’d never been so happy, all these hormones had me consumed in the joy of motherhood, but the crow’s health was failing. I could not sustain myself—it’s pathetic little heart beat weaker and weaker. I tried starving, I tried everything I could, I wanted to be a bird so bad. But it just wasn’t working out. The bird stopped working. The other crows held a funeral service for me, even though I was still alive. I tried to tell them, but I’m not good at speaking, you remember. It was all just a big mess.
I haven't seen Baxter since, but I still think about him a lot. Is that weird?
I’m totally over it though, haha.
After that incident, I got kind of depressed...but I was too much of a coward to do much about it. I possessed a lot of trash animals—gulls, racoons, and salespeople. I did what I could to survive.
That’s kind of where I am now.
I am currently living in Miami florida—been body surfing almost every day (haha). Right now I’m using a library computer and a librarian. She does not like being possessed, boy howdy are these fingers twitching. But you can thank her for my halfway decent grammar.
I’m tired of feeling like a parasite. I want to try a different approach. I want to be friends? Like with Richard Baxter except I also live in your brain and drink your blood sometimes. But I’ll make you bread in your sleep, so it’s okay. It’s been really hard finding someone willing to put up with me. I’ve tried everything.
So I thought I would put up an advertisement online, why not? Can’t say the P word in real life, but you can hear it in your head loud enough I hope.
I know I kept saying that I would compensate you financially, but I’m going to be real with you, I don’t have much. I’ve got like twenty bucks, some small pieces of plastic and a book about...finance....
But I’m a real hoot! ;D So, (P)lease, If you are interested, leave your comments below. I would love to get to know you :) I need to go now, the library is closing soon, but I’ll get back as soon as I can.

I'm not saying that anyone's immune system will take care of the virus but if everyone were to supplement by boosting your immune system to optimal levels then you would be less likely to get infected in the first place. Of course if you wear a mask in public, if exposed to the virus will give you a significantly smaller dose which will give your immune system a better fighting chance then without the mask. Go and watch the Korean director of viral infections on YouTube. In the interview, the question was asked - is there a cure and he responded by saying, ""as of right now there is no cure for the virus and the only thing that fights it is your own immune system.
I personally, take my vitamin a,b,c,d,e,k daily and based on my body weight take almost a kilogram of Vitamin C in ascorbic acid per month + 10 times the daily prescribed dose of vitamin D. I know that vitamins taken with minerals double or tripplle the effect. So vitamin C + niacin+ zinc and Vitamin D + calcium + magnesium doubles and tripples the absorption effect.
I've also started taking Chaga mushroom daily which works with vitamin C. When you take vitamin C, it's only in your body for one hour. Taking Chaga, helps storing vitamin C longer in your body. Chaga is the most anti viral substance on the planet and naturally fights pneumonia.
Some people would say that they don't need to suppliment because they eat and live healthy but i think that it's not enough to keep your immune system at optimal levels to prevent your self from the virus if exposed. 1 gram of vitamin C is equivalent to 6 oranges. Daily dose of vitamin D is being exposed to the sun shirtless for one hour daily.
I'll share my results from supplimenting with vitamins for over a year now.
I sleep like a baby, wake up feeling refreshed, don't even have the need to press the snooze button. I have more energy throughout the day and for the first time in my life broke the cycle of having annual cold sores.
Every year since I was 5, I would get one cold sore per year.. Ever since I moved to Calgary 6 years ago,( I'm guessing because of the climate ) I would get them 3 times a year. Supplimenting heavily with vitamins and minerals to boost immune system, not only did I feel healthier then I ever been but also for the first time haven't had a single cold sore since I was 5...
Shutting down the economy is not the solution to the problem. People will suffer more psychologicaly and financially from isolation and lockdows than the virus itself..
Don't even get me started about the mRNA products that is in fact an experimental vaccine. Studies are showing birth defects and infertilities. There are reports of women having abnormally painful periods. Also women in their menopause having periods again. There are also reports of people getting infected even if they are vaccinated. If it took them over 70 years on research and development to get a 40% efficiency rate for influenza, I'm skeptical about them having 90%+ efficiency for covid that only took one year to develop. There is currently no vaccine for Sars, MERS or HIV virus which is present in covid19 as inclusions. I'm not an anti vaxer but at the same time I refuse to be the experiential guiny pig for this mRNA product. This is the first vaccine in history to use such technology. FDA did not even approve of it but only authorized it for emergency use. Pfizer CEO now publicly stated that you need a 3rd shot, and now annual shots to be fully immune yet the government wants to release passports based on who's vaccinated or not....
Make your own conclusions, do your own homework. I'm not saying I'm right or wrong. This is only my opinion from doing my personal research on the subject.
Stay safe everyone!"
153,2021-04-19 07:42:00,Psoriasis everywhere within 3 months,"Hey all,
I recently just turned 18, and through all my life, i didnt have a single sign of psoriasis or anything at all. Earlier this year in about February, i noticed some dry patches on my elbow, knees and shin. I thought nothing of it, until i started seeing it a bit on my chest, I then went to see a GP and they said it was psoriasis, and gave me prescription for advantan, and then Daivobet.
That was 3 months ago. I now have guttate psoriasis all over my face, scalp, back, arm, shoulder, even in my ear, my nose and on my genitals )): it has gotten so bad just within 3 months and im just wondering if it has gotten this bad, this fast for anyone. Its just everywhere right now, the only place clear of it, is probably my feet
Ive had a referral to go see a dermatologist, but i currently do not have the money for that right now. Right now im just currently using the steroid creams, Ive been using daivobet, and it seems to clear up things pretty fast but itll just turn back to normal in 2 days or so. Ive heard that steroids can make your skin depend on it, and you can go through steroid withdrawal, so ive just been using the steroids for when i go out. The days when im just at home i just try to deal with it and use a moisturiser.
Usually when I use the steroid cream, i put it on 1 or 2 days before i go out, and my skin would be clear for about 2 days and itll just go back to what it was. Im not sure if i should just apply the steroid cream regularly but i just wanna get this psoriasis under control.
I started taking daily immune support, hair skin and nails, vitamin d3 1000iu and pills that make me calm. Im currently taking these once a day for about 1 week and a half and so far not noticing anything changing.
Its left me waking up with dry skin flakes everywhere, and sometimes i even scratch it in my sleep and wake up with dry blood in my fingernails and on my sheets. I now have dry skin flakes all over my keyboard. I find myself vaccuming my carpet every day because theres just flakes everywhere.
What do you guys think i should do ? this psoriasis is effecting my whole life and all the plans ive made for the future, ive gotten turned down from so many job interviews cuz its all over my face and arms. It looks like chicken pox on my face sometimes and i try not to be so insecure but i am. The steroids do help but its only temporary, only a few days and itll go back to red. I want to apply it every day, and just have clear skin again, but i cant because of all the negative outcomes.
Thanks for reading guys, i just dont know what to do right now. As im writing this im trying not care about it, but its come to a stage where its just so bad, and its just everywhere. Its not just a battle with the psoriasis anymore, its a battle in my mind that im trying so hard to fight. )):
At the end of the day, i should be grateful because some of you guys have it even worse, we've been dealt a bad card. Hopefully we can all, including myself can get over this and finally live a day feeling good about ourselves.
If you guys have any tips or anything that works please, let me know.
Thank you (('':"
154,2021-04-25 15:17:00,Opinion: I’m a Romany Gypsy – the government’s Police Bill will criminalise my culture,"The reasons much of the public support more draconian penalties for trespass is not that they hate the GRT community per se, but rather that current penalties have been insufficient to deter trespass, and they would support such regulations against anyone who engaged in similar conduct.. Similarly, the trespass is very often accompanied by related property damage and petty (or sometimes serious) crime.
Hatred toward GRT people is widespread. It is very much a reason why people support draconian measures, obviously there is no way to measure the extent that this is a primary component in support though. If more sites or negotiated stopping is not provided, how will this law deter trespass? It won't change the fact that many people have no option but to use unauthorised sites . The outcome will be that people have their homes taken away.
However, I get the impression that some of the GRT demands also include a near immunity to basic property rights and prosecution from many crimes, and that's not only someone few voters will support, but makes compromise on public access all the more difficult.
No they don't. Organisations like FFT and TravellerMovement have asked for local governments to provide sites as they have in the past, and should do at the moment, and have suggested negotiated stopping as another alternative/supplementary measure.
No one is asking for immunity to any law, nor immunity from prosecution from any crimes."

Right now my psoriasis is gone, but I can't contribute that to the supplements, I contribute that to being pregnant which suppresses the immune system and is known to help a lot of women with their psoriasis.

Since getting both vaccines in feb I have given up my protocol of zinc, 40 mg melatonin(two 10 mg doses and a 20 mg dose at night), vitamins C and D, and propolis throat and nose spray along with a saline nose spray that I used almost constantly- I sprayed the nose with propolis 5-6 times a day. The propolis was for the quercetin and I am sure it delivered. I’m sure everything delivered. I also wore swim clips to shut my nostrils and gargled with listerine after high risk exposures as well, such as sex with my never careful man. I never got sick and never got the virus according to the $25 Kroger antibody test. I can’t believe it. I had extremely high platelets after the vaccine and am following up with the oncologist tomorrow. I had arm pain for a month so we think that the supplements boosted my immune system, particularly the melatonin, and I never got the virus so it was likely the vaccine. I got some kind of cold 10 days after the second vaccine which we think was caused by the fact I had no immunity due to how cautious I’d been.

Except deficiency is different. You need vitamins to survive and if you don't get enough you body doesn't work and you die.
But that's not the same thing as claiming that you can boost your immune system by taking vitamin supplements. Few people are actually vitamin deficient and vitamin D won;t prevent covid-19 any more than vitamin can cure the common cold.
Unless you have a diagnosed vitamin deficiency, taking vitamin supplements only results in expensive urine.

Hey, i had covid November 29 and thought i was in the clear. I don't want to bring you down but it took be a while to recover. Today was my first great day. I was having digestive issues naseua, vomiting, diarrhea. I couldn't eat the way i wanted to even after getting my senses back.. when i got my senses back (2 weeks) after i thought i was in the clear but my digestive issues concerned me and so i got prescribed antibiotics, which helped a bit. I was getting pretty desperate and was looking for answers online and came accross articles that enlightened me. Being quarantine you lack vitamin d which is essential for your immune system and also came to conclusion that i wasn't getting the right nutrients in my body for my immune system to fight back.. so i loaded up on vitamins i started taking d3 2000 iu, zinc, and elderberry syrup and the result significant. I got a lot better within a day and now i feel great! I hope this helps. Take care and wish you a speedy recovery 🙏 Also if you're having digestive issues.. peppermint tea helped as well.

162,2021-01-09 19:05:00,76 per cent of hospitalized COVID-19 patients experience symptoms six months later: study,"
So in my case my post Covid symptoms were chest pressure and easy fatigue, I went to the doctor to get X-rays to make sure that I don’t have a swollen heart and it turned out that I was fine and that I just have like a sore rib cage or like the cartilage is sore? Basically it’s normal to have this after a respiratory disease and they told me it should be gone after about 2 weeks, but I should also be taking it easy. It’s been over 2 weeks at this point and it’s totally gone now, as for the fatigue I’d say that it’s important to keep in mind that your body is just weak after fighting this so my gym sessions haven’t been super hard, but I’ve been more focused on building endurance as opposed to “going hard”. I am still taking vitamin C and D supplements to build up my immune system as well and I’m also taking aspirin just in case so it can deal with any blood clots I may have?
The rest of my family has different symptoms than I do, more notably my mom still has a cough and was very nauseous after recovering. Her cough has been getting better she’s also been taking vitamin C and D supplements and walking to deal with the fatigue, her nausea has also gradually gone away?
TLDR: our bodies are weak after a new illness, and although we want to get back to strengthening ourselves we have to keep in mind that internally we are weaker so I would say be a little careful at the gym, don’t push too hard and just focus on getting back the endurance! :)

170,2021-01-08 01:16:00,Has anyone taken collagen supplements before?,"
I have taken several tubs of collagen powder over the last couple years. Collagen naturally occurs in meat, it is connective tissue. Contrary to what some people believe, we do use and benefit off of the connective tissues of animals, to form our own tissues, hair and nails.
Anyway, my hair was just below my shoulder blades 2 years ago, and now it is nearly to my waistband. My nails have always been strong and grow quickly, but they rarely break now. I have had a better diet in general, but I wouldn't hesitate to say that amino acids and proteins are great for many systems in your body. I get the Vital Proteins powder in huge tubs from Costco, they're everywhere now. But I put a scoop in tea, or in my morning oatmeal. I can't taste it, and it dissolves completely. Not gritty or anything. You can also drink bone broth for the same benefits.
Edit: also, no noticeable breakouts. If anything, my skin does better. I used to have dry patches that would never heal on my back and face, and now they're completely gone. I also take beef liver capsules from Vital Proteins. The capsules contain amino acids, bioavailable Vitamin A (what retinol is derived from!!), B vitamins (energy, immune system support and DNA synthesis!) and a little bit of iron. 10/10 recommended the beef liver and collagen supplements together.

They’re vaccinating about as many people every day as we have in the last month. In fact, multiple individual states have vaccinated more people than all of Canada despite having smaller populations. Source.
Puerto Rico has more vaccines than most provinces and it’s not even a US state. Guam has received 8X more doses per capita than all of Canada.
Even at their current rate, which will obviously speed up, 100% of the 265 million people eligible to be vaccinated would be vaccinated by July/ August.
Their largest national pharmacy chains, CVS and Walgreens, have said that they’ll each be able to vaccinate up to 25 million people per month - that would be on top of the health centres and facilities currently doing around 900k per day.

Fortunately I don't need to be the expert, I just need to read them. And in this case the expert consensus is that you cannot boost your immune system. Here are a few examples of what the experts say: immunologist Suzanne Cassel, infectious disease specialist Mark Crislip, and well-known science communicator and neurologist Steven Novella.
https://www.cedars-sinai.org/blog/boosting-your-immune-system.html
'Dr. Cassel says another common misconception is having a ""strong"" immune system is what's best for your body. '""You actually don't want your immune system to be stronger, you want it to be balanced,"" Dr. Cassel says. ""Too much of an immune response is just as bad as too little response."" 'Dr. Cassel says most of the things people take to boost their immune system, such as vitamins or supplements, don't have any effect on your immune response.'
https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/boosting-your-immune-system-during-a-pandemic/
""The short answer to the question – how do you boost your immune system – is that you can’t. The very concept of “boosting” the immune system is not scientific and does not exist within mainstream medicine. That’s because it is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of immunity, and of biological systems.""
…
""Vitamin D has a clear role in immune function, and vitamin D deficiency is now known to be associated with increased risk of auto-immune disease and increased susceptibility to infection. So again – your primary care doctor should check your vitamin D level and if you are low prescribe an appropriate supplement. This is a good time to reinforce the principle that there are optimal vitamin levels, and the more is not better. In fact you can have vitamin toxicity, including from vitamin D. So – targeted supplementation yes, routine or “mega” dosing no.""

100 fucking percent. I think there is much more than healthy school lunches that need to happen. Some schools have literally gotten rid of recess. Like play time. Active time for children. This is horrible. Though kids may carry the virus, the chances of them getting super sick are very very very low. Extremely low. Its still a good step in the right direction!! Healthy food options! Just eat some damned vegetables!!
There are plenty of good steps one can do to get healthy. A simple thing would be take a good supplement after having blood work done to see if you are deficient. I know I am vitamin D deficient, so I take a supplement. And to help my immune system, I take a C and NAC supplement too. These are per my dietitians recommendations, but any dr can run blood tests and tell you your deficiencies. There are even avenues where you can get a full spectrum blood test done for cheap and have a dr give you a few recommendations.
Another would be to just walk for a few mins every day. Simple things like little bits of exercise go a LONG WAY!! . I have nerve damage from an injury in the air force that limits my mobility - this is bad for me because it will only get worse. So I try and stretch and walk a bit up and down some stairs to give me a bit of exercise. I cant do much, but I can do something .
You see how you can affect your own health by making good choices? We dont have to be perfect , but if you dont wanna get sick, dont give your body the ability to get sick. Some things cant be prevents, but general health is ALWAYS a good thing!!
There are plenty of healthy things anyone can do to strengthen their own immune system. Simple changes - but people dont wanna change. They wanna be able to eat like shit, dont get the right vitamins, dont sleep or rest enough, stress their body out like crazy, barely exercise and STILL not get sick.
It just doesnt work. Gotta take care of the human body machine. Its a machine, it needs good fuel and constant care.
Oh and according to my girlfriend who is a registered dietitian - pop tarts, even though they say fortified with vitamins and minerals on the box, are not a substitute for good nutrition.

A lot of it is thanks to a lot of research and seeing what I was missing from taking a blood lab panel and a visit with a holistic doctor, which ouch, was out of pocket money for me, but she was really knowledgeable.
Probiotics (supplements and Kefir or Kombucha), provides good bacteria for your body Bone broth soup (helps heal gut lining and source of collagen) More salads and vegetables in general Hydration! 6-8 cups a day super important. Sometimes I drink 1-2 cups of water before I eat breakfast Flossing every day, it’s better to floss than be in more dental debt :( Exercise, actually my aunt just told me the other day that a lot of people are deficient in Vitamin D, we need up to 2 hours of sunshine a day so my personal resolution is literally to go out more Vitamin B Complex supplement Zinc, good to support immune system

178,2021-01-27 17:30:00,Why do I get so many UTIs? Any advice/input?,"
Recurring UTIs are a signal that your body is unbalanced unless your partner is super dirty or wears cologne/detergent that you are allergic to. I used to get them all the time - several turned into kidney infections - and I had to change my entire lifestyle to get rid of them. However, I haven't had one in 20 years. A bunch of thoughts:
If your immune system is weak, you need to take supplements like folic acid and vitamin C. Your microbiome is off. Do you eat fruits, vegetables, and other high fiber foods on a daily basis? Do you drink enough water? If you subsist on junk food and soda, your entire body lacks amino acids that it needs to stay healthy. Do you exercise? Exercise is important for your immune system and gut health, which will benefit your overall health. Take D-Mannose - it is a supplement that has had good results in trials.

It means having to relearn how to cook to your own satisfaction. It means learning to cook meat alternatives or buying expensive pre-made options. It is a massive change and not everyone is ready for it. And, if you're allergic to certain animal products, you can still get the same amino acid profile from other animal products. If you're allergic to key vegan staples, like soy, you absolutely cannot just swap to a similar staple and get the same nutrition.
Vegan foods are low in certain vital nutrients: b12, lysine, inosine (it's not required but it significantly helps folks with several diseases, including autoimmune diseases), etc. They can be supplemented but supplements are expensive , especially if you're only taking vegan supplements. We downplay it a lot but vitamin b12 deficiency can kill you.
It's a substantially cheaper diet for you, but there's a lot of factors that make it more expensive for others.

Hi food and nutrition guy here.
Evidence is starting to show that there are certain dietary and supplementation strategies that might be effective at reducing severe outcomes, especially for certain at-risk groups.
Sources please. I haven't seen any research yet around pre-infection nutrition status and Covid outcomes, not saying there isn't any but if there is I'd like to read it because it would be relevant to me.
Good nutrition is important for immune function, and supplementation can be useful when a person's intake in inadequate. Good nutrition status tends to lead to better outcomes in general, this is true.
However, improved nutrition isn't going to prevent the spread of Covid in the community, nor should someone who believes that they have a good diet consider themselves at lower risk just because of that . Also most of us treat our bodies like a fuckin dump truck. And while it's never a bad idea to eat better I'd be extremely hesitant to put out any nutrition advice as providing any specific protection from Covid.
So while I would love to see more public education on nutrition and cooking, I don't think it's a great pandemic response priority considering everything else at play. Though measures to improve food security in low income neighborhoods would definitely be appropriate.
Meanwhile when I was treating Covid patients we found that once symptoms become moderate to severe our main challenges became simple intake, both of food and fluids. If I have someone with a severe fluid deficit and a severe nutritional deficit due to poor intake I don't really care if they're eating chocolate pudding or if they're drinking juice all the time, as long as they're accepting it.

Regulation of immune function continues to be one of the most well recognised extra-skeletal actions of vitamin D. In vitro data have shown that vitamin D modulates immune cells and induces immune tolerance, while in vivo data from animal studies and from vitamin D supplementation human studies have shown beneficial effects of vitamin D on immune function, in particular in the context of autoimmunity. [1] In the present study, we examined whether vitamin D deficiency modulates the number of immune cells in COVID-19 patients.
This observational, single-centre study included consecutive COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients (N= 29), and consecutive patients hospitalised in a specialised non-ICU COVID-19 ward (N= 10), who were discharged from the hospital without being transferred to the ICU, from March 18th 2020 to May 25th 2020.
Vitamin D levels positively correlated with subpopulations of immune cells. Specifically, with cytotoxic T cells (r2= 0.344, p= 0.032), natural killer (NK) cells (r2= 0.496, p= 0.001), NK-T cells (r2= 0.325, p= 0.044) and regulatory T cells (r2= 0.333, p= 0.038). With respect to all other clinical and laboratory parameters, vitamin D levels correlated only with albumin (r2= 0.387, p= 0.018).
In our pilot, single-centre, limited sample size study, we were able to demonstrate that vitamin D deficiency was associated with reduced numbers of natural killer cells; specifically, vitamin D deficient patients presented with mild NK lymphopenia (<100 cells/μl), while vitamin D insufficient patients had normal NK cell counts (>100 cells/μl). This reported lymphopenia may obstruct the important cellular barrier during early viral infections in patients with vitamin D deficiency. A larger cohort of COVID-19 patients to study the correlation between vitamin D deficiency and NK lymphopenia and activation is required.

Before this regiment, I used to eat seaweed quite a bit too and it still wasn't enough.
What Can't Be Disputed: Fluoride was once used to treat hyperthyroidism before it was replaced. Halogens compete in the body(Fluoride, bromine and chlorine). The only supposed benefits of fluoride are related to oral health and even then, it can have negative consequences(Dental and skeletal Fluorisis). It's in food, water supplies, cleaning agents, pesticides, and supplements. As I said halogens compete in the body and the math of 150micrograms being the RDI of iodine is simply the very MINIMUM of all standards.. We all know how reliable this is in terms of an actual figure. Imagine reading that the 600IU of D3 that is recommended is all most people need.
Benefits: My anxiety has almost been cleared for the past six months. I'm allowed to partake in smoking marijuana time from time now. For five years, every high consisted of being shaky, jittery and anxiety ridden. My feet and hands were always cold, and it affected me half the year since I live in on of the coldest states. My ability to focus and concentrate was awful and it felt so stressful to actually do it. Now I feel much quicker in several areas of cognition(working memory, concentration, processing speed). I've had so many problems losing the last ten pounds I needed to for years. I could willpower 200lb-180 with no problem, but the last 10 I needed never came off until this time period. Sleep is more vivid and more efficient. Also, my temperature regulation was fucked. I was either really cold or hot. My head space feels like it's lifted. Imagine your perception when you're a little tired and your mood isn't happy, nor sad. Iodine felt like my mindset and perception got a posture change finally allowing it be lifted. My testosterone has increased with slightly greater jumps than usual in lifting and apparently erections have been more prevalent.
Dangers: (The comparison of thyroid cancer of the Japanese population is not a good indication. Seaweed also concentrates other halogens like bromide, and a few people eating absurd amounts over decades might affect the results). Regardless, areas of Japan are Blue zone representatives that have implemented seaweed in their diets. People with hyperthyroidism should avoid supplementation. Also people with autoimmune and other thyroid related conditions should get professional advice from multiple different people. Cofactors should always be taken with iodine supplementation
Regimen: 5mg-10mg Lugol's Iodine solution in the morning. I also took Vit D3 + K2(as Usual), 4 Brazil Nuts (300-380 Micrograms of selenium), 3x 500mg Vitamin C spaced out, 400mg of magnesium with a B complex containing 24g of Zinc and 3mg copper. Iodine went from 5mg a day for two weeks, then 7.5mg a day for two months, then 10mg for 3 months, then 5mg for two weeks. Now I'm just sticking to 2.5mg for now(Reduced Brazil nuts to two) . Blood tests are great, and there has been no excessive weight loss or increased heart rate. Actually, my heart rate variability has been better then ever which is somewhat a great indicator *sometimes* for health.
Anyways, I hope this helps some of you out. I know many people here deal with debilitating fatigue, weight problems and several other things that Iodine may help with. So do your research, remove all other factors that might cause symptoms from low iodine and never go overboard with it. The body also needs time to adjust for the first period of time so 1mg-2.5mg might be better for you in the beginning.

I agree with you and disagree with you at the same time. This doesn’t prove that a vit D deficiency is the direct cause of severe cases of Covid-19, but it doesn’t mean that this correlation is completely irrelevant. Vitamin deficiencies of any kind have always tracked with a higher likelihood of contracting a corona virus, like the common cold. This is especially the case with vitamin D.
The people who are making jokes like “100% of people who have contracted Covid-19 have breathed air” are funny, but it really doesn’t equate. Strengthening your immune system by taking the right supplements, eating right, and being active really will help. Being vitamin deficient and/or being overweight will hurt.
I’m not saying that vitamin D is the cure to COVID-19, but being mindful of your diet and taking vitamins to insure you are supporting your immune system certainly doesn’t fucking hurt.

Yes, the FDA has been sending takedown notices threatening fraud prosecutions to ""natural health"" and ""alternative medicine"" practitioners who have been professionally advising people and writing articles promoting Vitamin D & Vitamin C supplementation to help improve immunity vs. coronavirus.
If you're a professional medical doctor and say these things, you can also be disciplined and prosecuted for malpractice, because they're not medically established treatments and they don't appear in clinical guidelines for the treatment of infectious disease or coronavirus in particular.
Dr. Fauci is saying a lot of things, but he's a public health official stating an opinion, or offering comments and observatiosn, and not someone who is practicing medicine as a treating physician for an individual or specific group of people paying him as a physician (which is relevant to MDs) or making money off of promoting products or treatment approaches (which is relevant to natural medicine professionals).

From my understanding it’s multi focal and any answer isn’t exactly known - but for starters the vaccine is a dedicated particulate that we’ve identified as a good target as an antigen and supplemented with adjuncts to specifically illicit an immune response to promote antibody production/mem-b cells that can produce antibodies to that antigen. This vaccine uses the spike protein on the cell surface. Everything is designed to make a hopefully long lasting response. In natural immunity the picture is a lot more clouded. What did you body recognize as the antigen? What was the viral load and how much of the innate vs adaptive system clear. Did that exposure clear because of a response to something novel in this particular virus/strain? Etc.
I think one of the examples of how little we know is - even with much older and non-novel virus’s it’s not clear that antibody levels correlate with protective immunity in all cases. Some people develop the ability to mount a effective immune response with almost no circulating levels and others seem to require high levels.
So in short - we simply don’t know. Potentially they could be the same and the vaccine wouldn’t benefit people who’ve recovered. Or they could provide a totally different protection and prevent what could have been a reinfection. So at this point the risk/benefit is to give it to everyone so we don’t miss people thinking they are protected when they aren’t

There is a new study showing some success clearing up HPV infections which cause the cells to change (and lead to cervical cancer) through a treatment with AHCC. After reading about this I emailed one of the doctors about clinical trial opportunities. Sharing the link to the study and her response. I started taking AHCC daily but it’s only been a few months so I don’t have any anecdotal evidence to share. I stumbled upon this info though and wanted to pass along:
Study: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6435520/
“
Thank you the interest in our AHCC study for HPV+ women. I am sorry to hear about your experience but we are working hard to try and change the prognosis for those with HPV. We recently concluded our double-blind, placebo controlled phase II study that confirmed our positive finding in the first two pilot studies; we hope to publish the full study soon. We hope to open new phase II in the near future once we can secure funding to support the study.
AHCC is readily available as a nutritional supplement so you could always try on your own now too. I definitely recommend checking with your healthcare provider if it is okay to take AHCC for you. While it may not help, AHCC is well tolerated and unlikely to cause any harm/side effects. The AHCC dose I would suggest taking 3 grams once a day on an empty stomach (1 hour before meals or 2 hours after) for at least three months to six months to ""test"" if will help. Just be sure alone AHCC and taking equivalent to 3 grams (most 500 mg (take 6 caps=3g) or 750 mg(take 4 cap= 3g) or 1000 mg (take 3 cap = 3 g) capsules). We have observed combining with other immune support supplements can counteract benefits. There are numerous sources for purchasing AHCC just be sure you are getting real product - only manufactured by Amino Up, LTD- so will have ""trade mark (TM) or (R)"" symbol by acronym AHCC. If spelled out - it is NOT real AHCC. There are many copycat products out there. Some companies I know have reliable products include: Quality of Life Labs, Now Foods, and American Biosciences.

My Dad just felt weak and tired for a few days, tested positive, then slowly started to speak more slowly, slur his speech a bit. We picked up a pulse oximeter after some internet sleuthing and discovered is blood oxygen levels had dropped to the high 80s. Normal is 95-100%. Anything below 92% gets dangerous. We rushed him to the ER where he’s been for six days on supplemental oxygen and a course of Remdesivir and Dexamethasone. He had serious pneumonia yet never experienced any breathing problems. He’s improved every day and should come home within the next couple of days.
From my hours of anxious researching since this begins, I’m now convinced that this scenario is super common and probably contributed to many of the serious COVID hospitalizations. “Silent hypoxia” - people who didn’t have the well-publicized breathing symptoms and decided to avoid the hospital until it was too late. Most of these people need supplemental oxygen and probably a steroidal immune suppressant like dexamethasone which, as I understand it, keeps your immune system from causing inflammation in the lungs while it fights off the virus (not medical advice, just sharing what I’ve read).

Stuck between idiotic conspiracy theories and technocratic authoritarianism (as this column represents, that names ""mistrust of authorities"" as one of the blights of 2020), we're not doing well. People who actually make cognizant criticism of the media and government line are lumped in with conspiracy theorists constantly.
""Science"" is often used as a fallacious appeal to authority to silence people rather than referring to actual science. A scientist's opinion is not science, science is only testable, demonstrable and repeatable facts, and much of what has been called ""science"" in this crisis is anything but. It was ""science"" that masks didn't work until the day it was ""science"" that masks worked, and no study was at the origin of that switch, just a change in opinion at the top, and because of the developing authoritarian mindset, the opinion of public health authorities have been presumed to be ""science"" in the media.
Let me be clear, our ""authorities"" have been extremely incompetent during this entire crisis and mistrust of them is only reasonable given their horrible track record.

Despite the fact the Chinese authorities had implemented a complete lockdown of Wuhan and not allowed people to go in or out of the region, on January 31st, the WHO announced there was NO reason to limit travel or trade whatsoever, a recommendation they would maintain for at least a month. As a result, the virus spread rapidly in the world through international travel.
As late as March 7, Canadian public health authorities said COVID represented a low risk for Canada and kept repeating the most significant problem of COVID was... racism against Asians. One week later, lockdowns began.
The initial guidelines for treating COVID patients involved avoiding oxygen therapy and putting COVID patients on low blood oxygen on high-pressure mechanical ventilators. The mortality rate of that procedure was as high as 80%, fortunately, a few courageous doctors criticized the protocol and managed to get it modified or abandoned, but the first who spoke out were tagged as conspiracy theorists and received administrative punishments to force them to apply the protocol. A great example of how in health emergencies, bureaucratic public health authorities are very badly informed and need to pay attention to frontline staff, because that's where the information is. A lesson quickly forgotten.
In may, while the national academy of medicine in France urged vitamin D supplementation of at-risk groups to boost their immune system in case they get COVID, in Québec, public health authorities issued guideline to stop vitamin D supplementation in CHSLD.
We've known since April that swabs from COVID patients after 8-9 days of symptom onset do not produce viral samples that can be used to create viral cultures. Meaning, the viral phase of the disease likely lasts just 8-9 days, whereas hospitalized COVID patients tend to be hospitalized after about 7 days, at the end of the viral phase. Nonetheless, proposed antiviral treatments for COVID in large-scale clinical trials were only tested on HOSPITALIZED patients. Unsurprisingly, not a single antiviral treatment turned out to be effective at that stage of the disease... which was then used to justify not studying if the same treatments might be effective if given at the onset of symptoms instead (at the peak of the viral phase).
Groups of frontline physicians implored authorities to authorize corticosteroid use on hospitalized patients in early may (there's a testimony on the subject from May 6 at an American Senate Committee). The WHO advised against use of corticosteroids until September. Another good example of how public health authorities aren't at the cutting edge of science but months behind it, and yet these are the people our media and government trust in telling us what ""science"" says.
Despite lack of any evidence it reduced mortality, remdesivir was given an emergency use authorization by the WHO and most public health authorities in developed countries. Remdesivir is a 3000$-a-treatment drug that can only be given by perfusion, and a pure antiviral... allowed to be use only on hospitalized patients (at the end of the viral phase of the disease). The EU bought a billion euro worth of the drug the day before large-scale clinical trials proved it was useless in hospitalized patients. Meanwhile, we have 5 prophylactic clinical trials on ivermectin totaling 2 000 people all showing an effectiveness of ivermectin in reducing symptomatic infections of COVID-19 by 70 to 100%, and this drug is still ignored by public health authorities, not studied for emergency use authorization and no major clinical trial funded by governments in the developed world has been set up.
Next to no funding was given to early treatment or prophylaxis of COVID-19, despite the fact previous experience with infectious diseases reveal the earlier you treat people, the more effective treatments tend to be.
Québec is sitting on more than a million rapid tests of COVID-19, tests that though less reliable than PCR can be useful in finding asymptomatic or presymptomatic cases and isolating them earlier to prevent spread of the virus. They have had it since early October at least, they've done fuck all with them.
I can prove every single of these claims by quoting mainstream media, official government sources and scientific publications. And people who question public health management of the crisis get automatically tagged as conspiracy theorists and lumped in with those who deny the virus exists or that it's a scheme to put microchips in people through vaccines?

This does not address my concerns.
Fact 1. ADE seen in aged (and not selected to only look at the healthiest) but not young animals after vaccination for SARS:
To evaluate the efficacy of existing vaccines against infection with SHC014-MA15, we vaccinated aged mice with double-inactivated whole SARS-CoV (DIV). Previous work showed that DIV could neutralize and protect young mice from challenge with a homologous virus14; however, the vaccine failed to protect aged animals in which augmented immune pathology was also observed, indicating the possibility of the animals being harmed because of the vaccination15. Here we found that DIV did not provide protection from challenge with SHC014-MA15 with regards to weight loss or viral titer (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). Consistent with a previous report with other heterologous group 2b CoVs15, serum from DIV-vaccinated, aged mice also failed to neutralize SHC014-MA15 (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Notably, DIV vaccination resulted in robust immune pathology (Supplementary Table 4) and eosinophilia (Supplementary Fig. 5d–f). Together, these results confirm that the DIV vaccine would not be protective against infection with SHC014 and could possibly augment disease in the aged vaccinated group.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26552008/
Fact 2. ADE found only at low concentrations of anti-spike (S1 subunit) antibodies towards SARS:
We found that higher concentrations of anti-sera against SARS-CoV neutralized SARS-CoV infection, while highly diluted anti-sera significantly increased SARS-CoV infection and induced higher levels of apoptosis. Results from infectivity assays indicate that SARS-CoV ADE is primarily mediated by diluted antibodies against envelope spike proteins rather than nucleocapsid proteins. We also generated monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins and observed that most of them promoted SARS-CoV infection. Combined, our results suggest that antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins may trigger ADE effects. The data raise new questions regarding a potential SARS-CoV vaccine, while shedding light on mechanisms involved in SARS pathogenesis.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25073113/
Fact 3. Same thing seen as in #2 for SARS2 when checked:
However, when viruses infect cells expressing Fc receptors, such as Raji, K562, or primary immune cells, the antibody at suboptimal neutralizing concentration promotes virus entry into cells through interaction between antibody and Fc receptors (Figure 9). We found that amino acid substitutions F342L and E516A on RBD allowed the virus escape from the neutralization by 7F3 without reducing binding affinity to antibody.
[...]
These results also suggest that ADE may be more likely to occur at later time points after recovery from COVID-19 when the concentration of neutralizing antibodies elicited by the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection have waned to suboptimal neutralizing level.
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.08.20209114v1.full-text
Unless you have data on ADE when it is expected to happen , all you have is hope and assumptions.

Hi food and nutrition guy here.
Evidence is starting to show that there are certain dietary and supplementation strategies that might be effective at reducing severe outcomes, especially for certain at-risk groups.
Sources please. I haven't seen any research yet around pre-infection nutrition status and Covid outcomes, not saying there isn't any but if there is I'd like to read it because it would be relevant to me.
Good nutrition is important for immune function, and supplementation can be useful when a person's intake in inadequate. Good nutrition status tends to lead to better outcomes in general, this is true.
However, improved nutrition isn't going to prevent the spread of Covid in the community, nor should someone who believes that they have a good diet consider themselves at lower risk just because of that . Also most of us treat our bodies like a fuckin dump truck. And while it's never a bad idea to eat better I'd be extremely hesitant to put out any nutrition advice as providing any specific protection from Covid.
So while I would love to see more public education on nutrition and cooking, I don't think it's a great pandemic response priority considering everything else at play. Though measures to improve food security in low income neighborhoods would definitely be appropriate.
Meanwhile when I was treating Covid patients we found that once symptoms become moderate to severe our main challenges became simple intake, both of food and fluids. If I have someone with a severe fluid deficit and a severe nutritional deficit due to poor intake I don't really care if they're eating chocolate pudding or if they're drinking juice all the time, as long as they're accepting it.

Putting your body under stress can suppress your immune system while you recover, though it shouldn't usually be a problem unless you are at risk of getting sick already or have a particularly weak immune system.

NAD. I believe the culture will help shed some light. But on another note. I would suggest that you begin taking a vitamin supplement to help fight these things. Zinc is good for the skin and I think a general immune support supplement will be beneficial. Most of these contain Zinc. Also I highly recommend a probiotic as all those antibiotics aren’t doing your gut any good which won’t help with your body’s ability to absorb nutrients etc.

I'm so tired of trying to relieve my hip pain. I'm so tired of doctors accusing me of faking it for sympathy or pain meds. I'm so tired of ""but you're only 25!"" I'm so tired of ""but try for your kids!"" I've been trying.

What's your diet like? The food you eat plays a huge role in body odor. Here's a few things to consider
- Magnesium deficiency = most common in people who don't eat a lot of vegetables. Symptoms are body odor, muscle cramps, and twitching eyes. Supplements should help within a couple days
- Zinc deficiency = most common in vegetarians or people who eat a lot of junk food. Symptoms are body odor, skin problems like acne, low energy, and low immunity. Supplements should be taken with meals and should help within a week or two
- Digestive issues - most common in people who eat a lot of junk food, don't get enough fibre, or don't drink enough water. Symptoms are body odor, bad breath, mood issues like depression, low energy, and bloating / heartburn / constipation. Taking probiotics can help, as well as eating better in general.

"
246,2019-09-19 15:46:00,What comes after the (almost) carnivore diet?,"
Long story as short as I can make it.
Had ibs-type symptoms and migraines since childhood. PCOS since puberty, endometriosis-type symptoms and chronic pelvic pain developed later. Hysterectomy and ovaries removed at 45. No hormone supplementation. Felt somewhat better for 18 months until I ended up with viral cardiomyopathy (which we have a family history of) and severe congestive heart failure, then on top of that and all the necessary meds and low blood pressure & blood flow ended up with a stomach bug whilst recovering and 2 months of non-stop migraines with gastric stasis, and completely pooched my digestive system and ended up with oral allergy syndrome and possibly some actual food allergies too.
So I am eating beef, fish, coconut, olive and MCT oils, seaweed, small amounts of a few tropical fruits I don't react to (non-sweet ones like papaya), decaf coffee and very dark chocolate. So not completely carnivore but close. And my body is happy and my gut is healing but obviously this isn't a good long-term solution.
I had some genetic testing done and I am also a FUT2 non-secretor. Which means that I don't secrete my blood-type antigen in my gut, only in my blood. 80% of people secrete it in both places, and in the gut it is a polysaccharide that feeds beneficial bacteria. So non-secretors are prone to gut dysbiosis and some auto-immune diseases.
Now there is a company that makes a supplement that supposedly replaces what us non-secretors are missing. So that is an obvious place to start. I am taking boulardii, and a probiotic (despite knowing it's probably not helping). I'm just not quite sure what to do next. Especially since I can't currently eat almost any vegetables or any grains or nuts because of the oral allergy syndrome. I'm thinking my best bet is to start very slowly with tiny amounts of resistant starch like tigernut (which I think I can do), but I don't know if there would be a better option for starting to build up the large intestine health again?
"

(Not medical personnel either) Sounds like you'd benefit from seeing an integrative physician/functional medicine doctor. Many of them are MDs, but practice differently than regular allopathic doctors. And they routinely deal with cleaning up the issues you're having. If you choose to go this route, they'll probably run several blood tests. They'll quite likely prescribe probiotics to assist with repopulating your gut flora. Once they get the blood tests back, they might prescribe supplements to shore up your vitamin/mineral deficiencies, strengthen your immune system, or prescribe hormones if your thyroid/testosterone/miscellaneous hormones are off. It all depends on your blood tests and intake interview with the doctor.
It sounds to me (again, not a doctor) like there's a lot going on with you. I know you're tempted to try to fix this yourself, but it might be too complicated to be a DIY project. However a good integrative physician will be able to get you on the right track for healing without you going down any dead ends.
Good luck, and hope you get on a good healing track soon!

All very good suggestions in the comments. I want to mention because you have fibromyalgia, that you check out the brain retraining programs like the DNRS program, the Gupta Program, ANS Rewire, or EMDR trauma therapy. Chronic pain is often neurological and the result of a disordered autonomic nervous system due to trauma and being stuck in a chronic fight or flight response. That's what these retraining programs address.
I have found significant relief from all kinds of symptoms like rashes, headaches, brain fog, fatigue, muscle tension, insomnia, panic attacks, and airway inflammation, on these programs. Check out some of their testimonials to see what kind of results some people have gotten.
Keep working on your microbiome because that absolutely has a big effect on your brain and immune system, too. But remember that your autonomic nervous system controls the muscle movements in your gut, and when you are in a state of chronic stress and fight or flight the digestive system and immune system shuts down and creates a state where bacterial overgrowth is more prone to take hold.
I have been there with the being very skinny, so many food sensitivities, unable to sleep, worried about how I will work, etc. The DNRS program made a massive difference for my symptoms, and for me because it turned out I had autoimmune issues and liver issues, taking a glutathione supplement made a massive difference. Also I became a web developer so I could work from home and make my food at home, and I ended up excelling in my career. I know others in similar situations who became therapists or health coaches over skype so they could work from home.
Hope you feel better soon.

250,2020-10-29 14:47:00,"[29f] Anemia not responding to treatment while experiencing ADL effects, complicated by rare auto-immune... I've hit a wall and need some...","
Hi r/AskDocs ,
Sorry... Had to repost because I somehow broke Reddit and none of the comments worked. Blargh.
Dislcaimer: Before I start, let me state that while this post will not be NSFW, my profile is (so best not to click it). My apologies... it's the only account I have on here.
Background: I'm a 29 year old female that's been struggling with figuring out an autoimmune disorder for 15 years, during which I've received many diagnoses. In March my condition flared (I'm not going to list the symptoms of my AI here, but if they're pertinent to any questions, I'll go into them), and my blood results led my doctor to do a bone marrow biopsy. Through the biopsy, my autoimmune diagnosis was changed from Mast Cell Activation Disorder to Hereditary Alpha Tryptasemia. However, through that bone marrow biopsy, it was found that there was no iron in my bone marrow to show any kind of staining. Subsequent blood tests showed I was anemic. I definitely do not have heavy periods, and while I'm pescetarian, I eat a lot of veggies and fish. I used to fight my siblings for more broccoli and spinach as a kid.
Issue: Based on the blood work, my doctor moved immediately to infusions, as well as testing for why I was anemic. We did a blood test for a celiac panel, and my Gliadin IgG was elevated. I started infusions in June and did a series of five - one weekly through the third week of July. I had a bad allergic reaction with mild anaphylaxis after the first infusion, so the remaining six were a cocktail of Venofer, Benadryl, Pepcid, and Decadron. I'm going to list my blood results below, as well as link the full history, but they barely budged (if at all). With that fact, along with the elevated IgG, an endoscopy was scheduled to check for celiac disease. I had the endoscopy at the end of July, and subsequently ended up in the Emergency Room the next day with bad bacterial pneumonia (they put me under for the procedure and I apparently aspirated). Regardless, the test came back negative, and I was clear from celiac.
After the results from the endoscopy came in in August, my doctor repeated my CBC. My numbers for everything had just barely snuck into the normal range. This was about three weeks after my last iron infusion. At this point, my Doctor (who, I should specify at this point is a well-respected hematologist/oncologist) decided to wait for two months to see how the iron infusions sat and if my numbers continued to rise. He also mentioned that it could be possible it wasn't iron-caused, and we'd have to see how things fell.
Last week, I saw him again and had my numbers rechecked. All of my blood results have fallen again, and I'm back into the low category for many of my blood markers. I was... upset. My doctor's nurse let me know he wanted to start quarterly iron infusions, but I wasn't able to afford them (with the medications to prevent the reaction, they were costing $810 a visit. I'm on a high deductible plan). I asked if we could do an oral prescription, which in the past has made me horribly sick, but I'd rather try that route as it's affordable. The nurse reconvened with the doctor and came back to say he'd rather sit for three more months and see what happens with my numbers. I told her again that I'm not comfortable with that, and I wanted the prescription. That was yesterday. She stated my doctor would write me one and send it to my pharmacy, but nothing more on dosage or further steps.
So... I'm feeling a little lost here. My doctor hasn't confirmed with me that he's certain it's an iron anemia. As a past history, my grandmother almost died of anemia in the 80's. My great aunt is currently anemic and not responding to iron as well. My mother was anemic when she was pregnant. Additionally, I'm an athlete. I run ultramarathons, mountain bike, and work a fairly demanding career. The fatigue and lack of motivation has led to a daily struggle to even get up and get moving. My auto-immune condition already causes anaphylaxis and challenges with exercise, so adding another barrier has been soul-crushing. My doctor is aware of the fact that I'm experiencing symptoms of the anemia that's interfering with my day-to-day. My primary doctor has suggested I get a second opinion from another practice, but the practice he referred me to hasn't returned my messages.
In terms of the symptoms I'm experiencing, I've been having increasing amounts of fatigue, and for years I've had breathing issues with exercise that my autoimmune medications (allegra and pepcid) don't touch. My autoimmune itself has been spectacularly well controlled the past few months, but these issues haven't. To top it off, I've started having flu-like symptoms from extreme exhaustion after my long runs. It's made it hard to keep exercising, and the amount of fatigue is sapping me at work and affecting my job performance. I'm the head of my department, so I can't let that happen. My HAT does make my system exceptionally sensitive, so I'm wondering if I'm experiencing symptoms sooner than most would with these levels. My work and my physical actives are pretty much my whole life. Exercise is also critical to my mental health. So... it's been weighing on me heavily.
So... thoughts? Does this seem like iron based anemia? Should I be asking for more tests, or ruling certain things out?

Same here! I hate being a 1.5 and just waiting for inevitable death of my pancreas. I was diagnosed just about a year ago and have become obsessed with figuring out how to reverse it. I know it's not possible but why not try. Changed my diet and am on metform and trulicity which resulted in a 30 pound weight loss. I started researching and taking supplements that'll boost my immune system with the hope that somehow I stop it from from continuing. Becoming totally insulin dependent scares the living shit out of me.
Anyway, I got my labs back from my endo yesterday and was able to improve everything. My vitamin D levels are now perfect along with B12 both were very low a year ago. I was also able to reduce my GAD antibodies from 15 to 13 which I thought wasn't possible. The bad news was that my fasting C-peptide went from 1.25 to .86. I'm not sure how low your C-peptide needs to drop until you have to start with insulin but I know once it hits zero your pancreas is toast.

https://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/12/3060
https://www.menshealth.com/health/a19544352/what-infections-do-to-your-brain/
There is no evidence this decline is permanent for COVID, I suppose like most viral infections, the symptoms will go away on their own except for especially severe cases. That being said, the data is clear that most severely affected people have greater health consequences, which makes me wonder why we seem to be so little focused on trying to find outpatient treatments to decrease the severity of the disease, and no official recommendation at all on the subject.
Despite the fact even some health professionals like Fauci admitted they take vitamin C and D supplements to boost their immune system in case they are infected by COVID and that many studies found a very high inverse correlation between vitamin D levels and severity of the disease (even two small studies in France and Spain showing large doses of vitamin D supplements could reduce disease progression significantly), there is still no official recommendation or treatment guideline to ask vulnerable people to take supplements or that people caught early in the disease take high doses of vitamins (safe, cheap, widely available) and people who admit to taking a lot of vitamins like Joe Rogan are sometimes mocked as conspiratorial nutjobs and cranks by many.

Absolutely dead on. I started taking 5,000 IUs daily about 4 or 5 years ago and the number of times I get sick throughout the year has more than halved. And I have a school aged child who brings home who knows what. So there's that anecdote.
Also, anyone supplementing D should also make sure they are getting enough magnesium and K2 (no K2 if on blood thinner), so I supplement those as well. Magnesium helps with absorption and K2 mitigates any calcification of soft tissue that higher amounts of D could cause by shuttling calcium out of soft tissue and into bone. Excess K1 will do this as well, but K2 primarily does this.
Zinc is also a good one to supplement for general immunity as well as covid. Just make sure anyone takes that with food, because for me personally, zinc on an empty stomach is a bad time.

256,2020-10-26 03:08:00,[The Boys] Why can't Homelander see through Zinc?,"
Thinking about the materials science, we know Homelander can emit beams from his eyes - these appear coherent and very destructive but the effect is localised with lots of thermal, red light and little kinetic impact. If he can emit wavelengths in the 650-700 nm range (red light) and Higher into the infra-red (700-1000nm) as a weapon, perhaps he can use higher frequencies to see with like an invisible Microwave / mm wave radar. He ""illuminates"" the area he's looking at with a low power beam of microwaves and can 'see' using the back-scatter from surfaces. By using his eyes to focus on a point he can ignore intervening materials, effectively focusing though them.
Zinc is present in trace amounts in lots of things, yet he can see through them, so it seems only pure metallic zinc stops Homelanders vision. This seems to suggest he's emitting microwaves in the 1gHz range, precisely around the absorption frequency of zinc. It'd be interesting to see if this is a natural limit or a learned one, if he was made sensitive to zinc as a child, perhaps by being fed zinc supplements to boost his immune system?

I'm really sorry you're going through all this.
Your SO may qualify for an extension, you can ask r/unemployment if you need help with that. It's likely that if he quits his job, he will no longer qualify for unemployment, but there are a few exceptions to that.
If you want a bit more protection, you could check out evms covid protocol:
https://www.evms.edu/media/evms_public/departments/internal_medicine/EVMS_Critical_Care_COVID-19_Protocol.pdf
On page 4 there is a prophylactic supplement protocol that likely reduces covid symptoms or helps with immunity, though of course more data is needed to say for sure. It's pretty cheap and low risk to try it out though. Just keep in mind it's a broad protocol not tailored to your specefic medical situation, so make sure you don't have any contraindications.
I hope things start getting easier for you two! Best wishes.

1) canned beans vary greatly- but the only issue with them is high sodium found in many brands. however Trader Joe's across the board, and Costco black beans are fine (very low sodium)
2) Many of us have chronic vitamin deficiencies- especially if we have autoimmune disorders- Without a good vitamin D supplement? Id be dead in the water (and FYI, one of the best things other than wearing a mask and socially distancing for COVID? Take a Bit D pill if you are low).
3) smoothies are what you make them. To many commercial options use fruit juice, etc. But I make mine at home with fat free no sugar added greek yogurt (sometime use 2%, its fine), nondairy milk (I know that sounds odd- but I also know the inflammatory profile data on milk vs real yogurt), low GI fruits - raspberries, blackberries, peach and/or banana (1c of berries, 1/2 a peach or banana), maybe 1/2 avocado if I need the calories, 2 s of greens, 1t of cinnamon, 1 t of turmeric, 1T honey, scoop f prebiotic fiber and hemp protein. I have not done the calories on this in awhile, but I generally drink 1/2 of it each day. I get 250-350 cal, 3-5 servings of fruit and veg, 20-35 gr of fiber, healthy fats and enough protein for my body (I eat 10-12% max protein due to inflammatory issues- it does not work for everyone!). But sure, a 16 oz Jamba Juice thing with liquid sugar all over the pace can be 7-900 cal! Certainly not automatically healthy or terrible.

Pretty high multiattack, unique attack that makes it easier to cap, dodge rate boost for extra survivability, high debuff success rate and plenty of useful debuffs, such as stackable atk/def down and MA down.
You have a special delay that ignores Delay immunity and boosts charge bar, a Miserable Mist that inflicts a supplemental damage debuff, a cooldown reset that boosts your charge bar and a low cooldown S1 that inflicts a variety of random local debuffs. Lots of multi hit skills make this class synergise well with supplemental damage and work pretty good for V2 fights.
The fact that the class is Bow only did push some Bows that were previously lying unused into relevance, but it also significantly limits the options you have to work with in certain elements (like Dark, which has a hard time because the only decent bow is Qilin Bow, which isn't that great). That aside, the class is great and I would say has mostly powercreeped Chaos Ruler as the primary debuffing class that can be used for hard content.
The class has some good synergy with Lobelia and Fraux too. Lobelia cuz Thunderbolt of Disaster synergises well with cooldown reset and the skill cooldown cut is great for Robin Hood. Fraux because she can extend almost all of Robin Hood's debuffs because they're local.
I've used Robin Hood to clear the Gilbert and Violet Knight Proud Battles, using Hollowsky Bow and Draconic Bow respectively. The class is very fun if you have a good MH. And if you don't, you could always craft the CCW, which has stackable debuff res down and dispel on CA and significantly buffs MC with up to 50% echo based on enemy debuffs and 5 turn cooldown 1 time Dodge All.

267,2020-10-23 14:13:00,Could multi vitamins make things worse?,"
The overcharged immune response is called cytokine storm. This happens when the body is fighting some virus and, for some reason, an excessive release of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules called cytokines is triggered. It has nothing to do with having your immune system enhanced by taking vitamin supplements.
However, you should be careful in your dosage because some vitamins in excess can lead to adverse effects. You'll be fine if you take multi vitamins, but don't panic and start eating a bunch of pills or mixing supplements.

Yup! Also there is mounting evidence of how low vitamin D is connected to more severe COVID response. In my case there is also a connection between Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis and vitamin D deficiency. It’s recommended to supplement which helps to lower inflammation and autoimmune response in Hashimotos. I believe it is the same thinking behind COVID and vitamin d. D helps with inflammation and people hospitalized from COVID tested to be D deficient.

Ty and sure. I caught the virus at a family get together of 15 women and teenagers. We had a aunt and nieces day where we talk and try to get closer. One of my aunts had been sick prior and in the hospital for 2 weeks but when they took blood from her the covid results came back negative. So she thought it was fine for her to come to the get together. That day all of us caught it but one person. We all began experiencing symptoms 4 days after that day. My first symptom was headaches. Then after my taste and smell started getting weak. Like I could taste if something was too salty or sweet but after 2 days I lost it completely. So did my family. I went and got some zinc, and elderberry medicine from vitamin shopp. It seemed to help but for the next days I started not being able to breathe. I started having anxiety really bad. My chest was tight. I didn’t have no appetite what so ever. I never had a fever. And another thing is, my husband stayed with me in our small apartment. He stayed in the other room but pretty much he was exposed to it the day I caught it and after. He never got it. He went and got tested twice and never got it. But I was told, u can be immune to it but still pass it on to others so he quarantined with me. Still never got it. Lol and as the days was going by, one day I would feel fine then the next I would feel completely horrible. It was like a repeating cycle like that for all 14 days. Close to the end, my nose started running. I felt pains all over and I just wanted to sleep the whole time. My mouth was extremely dried out. I’m was weak the whole time. On my 15 day I went and got tested and it came back negative. BUT!!! I still couldn’t taste nor smell a thing. It’s been 2 months and my taste and smell is back but not 100%. Some things I can taste better then others. My mom is 61 and almost died from it in the hospital but they gave her someone who survived it plasma and that worked for her. She doing well and so am I. And everybody else that caught it that day is fine too. Overall it wasn’t a good experience. And the thing is, before I got it I tried my hardest not to catch it. Bc I know my immune system never really been that strong but I got through it. If you or someone you know has it my advice is, take your vitamins. Take zinc, and get some Elderberry immune builder syrup. Drink a lot of water bc your mouth gets super dried out also. Even though I didn’t I advise to walk and sweat. Because the virus doesn’t want you to move around so it can get worse. If you work it out of you, it helps. That’s how some of my family members got through it. Go to the hospital immediately if you can not breathe. I did not go. I just prayed to God. Lol but I understand not everybody believes so go to the ER if you feel like you’re going to pass out or can’t breathe. After you use the bathroom, clean and sanitize. You want to get up and sanitize every day. Stay clean and by the way, that day I did not have on a mask. None of us did so mask are really important. If you have any other questions I will be happy to answer the best way I can. ❤️

People who think they are taking the moral high ground through cussing out runners in public are brainwashed. We haven’t worn masks during flu season in the past, and if you are infected with the flu, you don’t blame other people’s actions for your infection. Granted, the mortality rate for COVID is significantly higher, but it’s not anywhere near even 1%. Despite special cases sensationalized in the news of perfectly young, healthy people dying from it, statistics don’t lie.
Also, people are acting like wearing a mask alone is going to solve it. Taking vitamin supplements, getting exercise, and eating healthy all help to boost the immune system. I personally haven’t seen anything other than distance, masks, and hand washing being recommended by the CDC.
My advice to the fatass Karen’s on facebook is go outside, run, and stop being fucking obese, as obese people are at a much higher risk of death due to COVID.

Last year I had a really bad throat infection and gargling salt water helped temporary with the pain and healing process just it makes you want to throw up because it’s so salty. If you’ve got a cold it won’t help though salt water would only help with infections because they are bacteria, colds are virus’s they are weak to heat but you can’t heat up your lungs or face to 60C/140F and above without you dying too. So what I’m saying is you can try salt water to see if it’s an bacterial infection. Virus’s won’t be killed by herbs or antibiotics. The only things that kill it aren’t safe to consume with the exception of some that can be treated with antivirals but many antivirals are still undergoing testing to see how effective they are. So gargle salt water if you want and see if that helps and if it doesn’t you can take 1 vitamin C tablet a day they help your immune system at fighting sickness so it can make you make better faster.
No worries have a good day/night and you don’t need to stress you’ll be ok

I’m a student researcher at a hospital and remedesivir is the standard of care now and the preferred therapeutic when it comes to hospitalized patients.
Dexamethasone is still going thru the validation process to make sure the data it presented is truly statistically significant and the results weren’t due to chance. It is also not as widely administered because most healthcare professionals don’t want to waste time using a drug that is still going thru the validation process instead of the standard of care just for it to not have an affect, which could result in lost time, a more sick patient, or lost time.
Vitamin D and other supplements are to assist the immune system and they don’t directly “attack” the infection itself either, so if a person is already immunocompromised, vitamin D will not do much help. However, most patients are tested to check for their levels of vitamin D, C, histamine, etc. to make sure they don’t need any administered and if they do, they will be administered the proper dose.

You assumed correctly. There are no legit studies showing any of the claimed effects from taurine or any of the other fancy snake oils, and the b vitamins can't give you an energy ""boost"". Vitamin deficiencies can cause fatigue, so supplementing them can treat that if you have that issue, but the idea of a boost above where you're normally at is just BS, like with vitamin C supplements ""boosting"" your immune system.

Full Article Text
Vitamin D is produced in the skin under the influence of UVB-light from the sun or obtained via the diet by eating fatty fish, enriched dairy products or supplements. Vitamin D is known to support a healthy bone and severe deficiency may lead to osteomalacia or the rickets, which still occur in poor areas of the world. In addition, vitamin D support key functions in many organs, including the brain, muscle and the immune systems (Holick, 2007). In fact, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed in most cell types and may activate somewhere between 200-500 genes, many related to the immune system. Thus, the role of This article is protected by copyright. All rights reservedvitamin D in human immunity has been studied intensly during the past 20 years (Hewison, 2011). For example, it has been hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation may prevent acute respiratory infections (ARI), which is based on the fact that these infections are much more common during the winter, which coincides with lower vitamin D levels in the population (Hypponen and Power, 2007). Moreover, experimental evidence showed that vitamin D can activate antimicrobial peptides, which are secreted at mucosal surfaces and have the capacity to kill bacteria and viruses (Hewison, 2011). These observations spurred several randomized controlled trials (RCT) testing the hypothesis. The results from these trials were not conclusive, with some showing beneficial effects and some not (Bergman et al., 2012;Murdoch et al., 2012). However, a large individual patient data meta-analysis compiled individual data for almost 11.000 patients from 25 RCTs (Martineau et al., 2017). A general preventive effect of vitamin D supplementation against ARI was observed. The effect was greater in those with vitamin D deficiency (< 25 nmol/L) and if the supplement was given daily or weekly but not if given as large bolus doses
A recent narrative review explains the rationale for further studies of vitamin D and Covid-19
Given data supporting that vitamin D could prevent ARI, it was natural to ask the question whether vitamin D could prevent Covid-19. This was addressed in a narrative review by Rhodes et al, published in JIM (Rhodes, 2020). The authors first present a clear link between vitamin D levels and Covid-19 by comparing the mortality of Covid-19 in relation to the latitude of different countries. They observed a 4.4% increase in mortality for each degree latitude north of 28 degrees north, a link that remained after adjustment for age. This observation suggests that UV-light, and thus indirectly Vitamin D, may be involved in the protection against Covid-19. However, it should be noted that UV-light also has a number of vitamin D independent effects on immunity, such as suppression of T-cell activation in the skin, which may explain this observation (Bernard et al., 2019). In addition, the link between UV-exposure and Covid-19 mortality on a nation-wide level is complex and may be severely hampered by inherent bias.
Further, they point out the fact that factors associated with death from Covid-19 (old age, ethnicity, male sex, obesity, diabetes, hypertension) overlap with risk for vitamin D deficiency. Although this is striking and something that deserves further studies, it may be fully explained by the “healthy user effect”, i.e. that healthier people simply spend more time outdoor and eat healthier, compared to less healthy individuals, thereby explaining this overlap.
Rhodes et al also refer to the fact that vitamin D deficiency is a general risk-factor for ARI and that supplementation may prevent ARI. This is clearly shown in associative studies but also in some interventional randomized and placebo-controlled trials as well as in one large individual patient data meta-analysis (Martineau et al., 2017). Notably, some recent associative data on the link between Vitamin D and Covid-19 is presented in this narrative review. One questionnaire-based study of Italian patients (n=1486) with Parkinson disease reported that those taking vitamin D supplements were less likely to have Covid-19 (Fasano et al., 2020). Another small Italian study (n=107) reported that serum-levels of vitamin D was lower in patients who were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 (D'Avolio et al., 2020). A third study from the US is mentioned (n=4314) where low vitamin D levels increased the risk to test positive for Covid-19 (Meltzer et al., 2020). However, this study is published at a pre-print server and therefore not properly peer-reviewed, which is a common problem in these pandemic days where quick publication is of paramount importance. There are also studies – also published as pre-print publications - that failed to find a link between low vitamin D levels and increased risk of Covid-19 infections (medRxiv 2020.04.29.20084277; medRxiv 2020.06.01.20118943). Importantly, there is no data from interventional trials showing that vitamin D supplementation may prevent against Covid-19, although such trials are under way.
Finally, Rhodes et al present arguments that vitamin D increases the conversion of ACE2 to ACE, which potentially may protect against Covid-19. Again, this is an interesting hypothesis but only shown in experimental settings so far and thus lacking clinical validation
What are the implications for the Vitamin D research field?
To conclude, the implications for the Vitamin D research fieldthere is a strong rationale to study whether vitamin D may prevent Covid-19, given previous publications in the field. Future studies should involve experimental models to assess whether vitamin D can impair viral replication, block proinflammatory cytokines or have other effects related to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here it is crucial to select the best model system where vitamin D responsive host factors are active. For example, the virus grows well in VeroE6-cells, but these cells are of primate origin and may not represent the best model. The virus is significantly more difficult to grow in human cells, but it is possible (Banerjee et al., 2020). Further, large epidemiological studies can be employed to assess whether vitamin D levels correlate with the risk to get infected by the virus and also if vitamin D levels are associated with the severity of disease. Importantly blood levels should not be too old, but rather obtained within a 6 month period prior to disease-onset to give a meaningful estimate of the impact of disease by vitamin D levels. Finally, and most important, is to perform randomized and placebo-controlled trials to test the hypothesis whether vitamin D can prevent Covid-19. Special consideration should be given to the inclusion criteria, where only those deficient in vitamin D should be included, to maximize the potential effect. Also, a daily dosing schedule may be superior to weekly or monthly dosing, as judged by previous data (Bergman et al., 2013;Martineau et al., 2017)
How should the clinician deal with this information about vitamin D and Covid-19?
It is not easy to fully understand the complex mechanistic underpinnings of vitamin D mediated effects on immunity and translate this into the clinical practice. A simple rule of thumb could be the following: 1. Vitamin D is safe. Recently, results from a large meta-analysis failed to find any evidence that vitamin D caused adverse events in previously healthy people (Martineau et al., 2017). Doses up to 10.000 IU/day is safe, although well above what is needed In fact, only 1000-2000 IU may be needed to obtain optimal effects on bone and immunity. Nevertheless, special attention should be paid in patients with certain rare diseases, such as tuberculosis and sarcoidosis, where ectopic activation of vitamin D may lead to hypercalcemia. 2. 1000-2000 IU/day is enough to keep the immune system healthy. No mega-doses are needed and may only lead to increased risk for adverse events. Small and daily doses are enough to boost immunity. 3. If possible, test your patients for 25OHD-levels in serum and provide only supplements to those below 50 nmol/L. This will protect the bone and be enough to enhance respiratory immunity against ARI. By adopting this limit, you will only supplement individuals that need extra vitamin D, avoid unnecessary costs and follow available guidelines for bone-health. 4. Be aware that the beneficial effect is small and may take some time (months) to develop. However, given the common problem with ARI and especially now in the corona-epidemic, a small vitamin D supplement may be beneficial, and definitely not harmful. Risk-groups (dark skin, the elderly, patients with chronic diseases and obese patients, to mention a few) should have first priority for supplementation.
Finally, the field of vitamin D and Covid-19 is very active and several trials are under way. Thus, new data will come, which may change these conclusions. However, in the meantime the conclusions above can be followed and we have massive data to say that vitamin D at low doses (1000-2000 IU/day) are safe and not harmful, which is in line with the historical proverb: primum non nocere (first, do no harm) – but potentially we may prevent a number of ARIs and perhaps also Covid-19.

306,2020-07-19 05:06:00,My dad beat covid-19,"
I'm glad, and I don't want to be that guy . Heads up, I am not a medical professional, and this is not medical advice. It is, however, a serious warning to continue monitoring your father's physical and mental wellness as closely for the foreseeable future.
Recent findings since May 2020 in both the US and Europe have confirmed an increasing proportion of COVID-19 patients have no respiratory or flu-like symptoms. In the US, something termed ""corona toes"" has begun to appear in teenage patients. These are red, painful lesions on and between their toes. That is the furthest part of the body from your heart, and similar lesions and discolorations are likely to appear in persons with circulatory issues, including some cases of high blood pressure and heart disease. These become likely to occur in persons with reduced immune response, as our blood is one of two key pathways for white blood cells.
This reflects a similar finding in COVID-19 patients who experience respiratory and flu-like symptoms. In those patients, cytokine pathways, which normally signal immune response, overproduce and become something called a ""cytokine storm"". I'm oversimplifying this, but a cytokine storm is an accelerated production of cytokines so much so that your immune system is overwhelmed and instead becomes more ""scorched earth"" on all cells, even healthy ones. This causes massive inflammation, which can further impede immune response and prove fatal.
What's worth pointing out here is that while autopsies are revealing cytokine storms occur, a series of four forensic autopsies in Europe revealed two surprising findings: the presence of COVID-19 in cerebrospinal fluid, and the official causes of death were embolism (blood clots). Embolisms can mean any number of complications from COVID-19, but the one that convinced me to practically live in my mask is the presence of COVID-19 in cerebrospinal fluid. If COVID-19 was found in someone's spine, the virus can spread into the lymphatic system, the other key transport for our immune system.
This month a wide range of young adults in my age group began reporting no respiratory, no flu-like symptoms; no ""corona toes""; and no other known circulatory issues, including any preexisting and/or unknown risk for heart disease or HBP. Instead, they were experiencing the most debilitating migraines. All tested positive for COVID-19. This week, a 13-year-old boy died during self-isolation from COVID-19 after a test on July 8 returned negative.
I don't believe COVID-19 is a respiratory illness anymore. And as a moderate-conservative, I don't think the facts are pointing at all to this virus just dropping off the face of the Earth in a few months' time. I can't trust a sero test at this point, because they are just doing nasal and saliva testing. If this thing is a cardiovascular illness, we need blood testing.
So, the silver lining in all this is that your dad may likely be able to limit his future risk by keeping a magnifying glass on his heart and circulatory health for the next several months.
Aside: I was shocked to hear rumors that Wuhan health officials were successfully improving outcomes in patients given sodium ascorbate and potassium. That's a mineral salt of Vitamin C and a key supplement for retaining hydration from water. If patients were more likely to survive by taking an immune supplement and hydration salts alongside continuous treatment, that must mean something good.
I wish you the best. Be careful, and don't treat this like it's over. This is just a small victory, albeit an important one, in getting your dad out of this as good as he once was. Buckle down and take whatever it takes.

You'd have thought they'd update this stuff. With a medical background...there's just no logic to some of it.
With regards to supplements, they aren't the cure-all. But it should be another part of the prevention/treatment plan (IMHO), because there's a list of them involved with how the body fights viral infections. I'd encourage anyone to read up on how the body fights off viral infections (the adaptive immune system - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6212925/ and https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-020-0191-1 - the first link goes into the vitamins and minerals a little more), the mechanisms behind the infections, organs effected, etc. A lot of the bad information you see and hear is just a lack of knowledge about the subject. Wikipedia is an easy place to start. Google Scholar is another good way to get up to date info, though you might get bogged down by a lot of the medical jargon and a few paywalls. Taking my word...well, I always tell people to get at least a second opinion from anyone (doctors included) with medical stuff:
First thing, remember you aren't just fighting off COVID, there's a lot of co-morbid things involved like pneumonia and the flu ( https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm ), it may not make you sick or kill you directly, but getting the flu shot probably would be smart this year. And anything helping the immune system to fight those things would help (there's a much longer list for all that).
Basic Diet and Exercise. Since obesity, hypertension, and smoking are/suspected to be increased risk factors, these are easy to adjust. Of course, getting someone to walk a mile or not eat fast food everyday might be harder than masks.
Vitamin D has been researched with COVID and a few acute respiratory infections (notice you can get this checked really easy via a simple blood test if you think you might be low). Honestly, buying supplements might even not be necessary, just some more sunshine:
https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/4/988 https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m2475.short
Vitamin C is easily checked via the blood, but with a lot less solid research (sorry Linus Pauling): (it's towards the bottom) https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/treatments-for-covid-19 And I think this is the study they are talking about in the previous link - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137406/ Here's one talking about taking it for a cold https://www.health.harvard.edu/cold-and-flu/can-vitamin-c-prevent-a-cold
This is just the obvious stuff. There's a lot more less researched and more controversial stuff out there....for example:
Zinc - Whenever you see something in the headlines, always question ""Why?""...there is some stuff to back it up in theory https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666901/ , but the reality is different (at least on the research side): https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/expert-answers/zinc-for-colds/faq-20057769 . But the Zinc thing just goes back to the immune response thing and knowing how the body works. Most supplements are easily checked via blood work, many probably don't need every single supplement, but a ton need at least a few.

Vitamin D had a quite strong non-classical role in the immune system. It is anti-inflammatory and simultaneously supportive of immune defences. The mechanisms aren't entirely clear yet, but we know for a fact it can induce the expression and secretion of antimicrobial compounds like cathelicidin and beta-defensin. Vitamin D deficiency is certainly a player in a weakened immune system, but whether it's supplementation when it's already normal boosts the immune system is another story. It's still being studied.

This is what I've been trying to tell my aging folks in AZ. They are unfortunately stuck in an information bubble.
Last time I talked to Mom about vitamin D she told me that she saw on the news it doesn't prevent Covi. I told her that while this is true that it's not the point. The point is to have your immune system tip top so that it might be better able to fight a Covi infection, it any infection for that matter.
Dad's a hard headed Vietnam vet who ""knows everything"".
I think that one thing people aren't really looking at here in places hot like AZ is that people often limit their exposure outside due to the heat. Less sunlight means less D production. So for people who mostly stay inside they might not have enough D production unless supplemented through diet or pills.
Also vitamin D isn't a golden ticket to a good immune system. Diet, SLEEP and other factors also aid in this and should be used as well for maximum immune system health. At least in my personal opinion since I'm not a doctor and all that yadda yadda stuff.

My diet on the testing days are crap because I eat breakfast and lunch over there, and they are just sandwiches.

I'll definitely take your suggestion on working out before I head out. I'm 100% not a morning person, and I need to be up by 6 am. I end up skipping breakfast and my protein shake to get out the door, and the mornings are chaotic at the site (which is no good for my calorie intake).

317,2020-07-13 04:19:00,Seeing my friends with long haul post-COVID symptoms has destroyed my mental health.,"
I applaud you for being involved, and you have a lot of empathy for the suffering of others. But be sure to take care of yourself and try to find a little joy in life still, because you are doing important work, and we all need to remain strong for each other. I'm really curious about what contact tracing is really like, we hear a lot about it.
I myself began following what was happening in China back in January, and began to warn people, but no one really took me seriously. I have a kidney transplant, so I was especially concerned, but in January I got what I believe (in hindsight) was Covid, and I was very fortunate that all I got was an upper respiratory infection and was able to overcome it. I used supplements such as Monolaurin and Ester C to help me. The doctor simply told me to go home and get well my own. I believe that the transplant medications I take, suppressed my immune system so much, that it couldn't so easily going into the cytokine storm. A reaction that has caused so many patients to go critical.
I definitely remember how much it took the life out of me for probably 2 to 3 weeks after I got over it. I became thin and weak, and it was really surprising. I've never had that response from having any type of virus.
It was also scary today when I read that they are finding on autopsy, that victims of covid had clotting throughout their system, blood clots in organs and all over the place. I've also read that it can be considered somewhat of a vascular disease because of these effects. No matter what you call it, I hope that everyone stays well informed about their options.
I never recommend anyone circumvent medical care in place the vitamins if they have serious symptoms, but I have always believed in a multi pronged approach. I do recommend safe use of immune boosting supplements in the proper manner, depending on your own health record and what you should and shouldn't use for your specific situation, to help prevent even coming down with the virus.
Just today, I was reading that Quercetin, one of my long time favorite supplements, is the newest subject of a medical trial to test its efficacy against Covid. In 2004 Chinese researchers found that it blocked the pathway to SARS viruses attaching to human host cells. This is exciting news as many of us prefer natural options when we can get them. There is also a doctor who was having much success using the drug Budesonide that can be put in a nebulizer. He said does wonders not only against the virus, but also in helping the lungs quickly recover. He also shared that this is a treatment they have used in Taiwan, with 23.7 million inhabitants, among the most densely populated countries. With all their crowding, Taiwan has only had 7 deaths this entire year from covid. He is a prominent doctor from Texas that is well known in the area. He had people that were very ill, even on cancer treatment recover within a day or two, get back to being active, and also show up negative on testing over a short period of time. I love stories like these, and I try to share whatever helpful info I can with people, because we need all the options we can get, since not everything works for everyone. It does break my heart when you hear those rare stories of people who thought they could handle it at home and gave their kids this or that, and their kids didn't make it. Of course, you never know How a person's body is going to fare, but if you can't breathe, get to a doctor already. Hydroxychloroquine can help, but it's not for critical care, it is to help milder patients recover. It has been misused in the medical setting, and in trials. So, they are starting that trial over, hope they get it right.
As a person on immunosuppressants, I myself have had to rely on doctors to keep me alive, despite my strong disposition toward natural medicine. I have learned to educate myself over the past 30 years, and include the best of both worlds, whenever I am not well.

Hmm...while a strong immune system can only protect you so much I do agree that there should be more attention brought to boosting it. Since I started keto I've been trying to take good care of myself. This includes taking certain vitamins and supplements that boost my immune system. Because I work at a hotel in the laundry department I got sick from leftover germs quite often. But now that I keep my immune system strong it's been a while since I've been sick.

You assumed correctly. There are no legit studies showing any of the claimed effects from taurine or any of the other fancy snake oils, and the b vitamins can't give you an energy ""boost"". Vitamin deficiencies can cause fatigue, so supplementing them can treat that if you have that issue, but the idea of a boost above where you're normally at is just BS, like with vitamin C supplements ""boosting"" your immune system.

That's really tough, I understand your valid concern. Possibly you can encourage her to take some preventive supplements, such as Ester C in low doses, Monolaurin now and then, chelated zinc, D³, whatever she is allowed.
The combination of Ester C and Echinacea Plus Tea, by Traditional Medicinals brand, is my best recommendation always, for anyone with anything respiratory or flu like or viral. I can't take the Echinacea, because I have Lupus and a transplant, so I personally will just do the C and Monolaurin.
To clarify, I do NOT recommend someone that gets active Covid, ignore it and just take vitamins, but I am saying that if you get sent home by a doctor, to try to get over it on your own, these things can also be extremely helpful. People need to use common sense, if supplements are not helping and you are getting worse, definitely keep visiting the doctor.
*Never take echinacea if you have an autoimmune disorder.
These immune boosting supplements help you fight off the virus, if you are going to be exposed on a regular basis like that.
Another really helpful thing that she can do, is to make sure she rinses her sinus once or twice a day with some sinus rinse. My head and neck surgeon swears by this method. He cleans out the sinus regularly, and never ever catches a a thing. And he deals with an awful lot of patients, hes a very busy doctor. He said that this is because the sinus is where the viruses take hold, and if you wash it out into the digestive system down the throat, it can't start germinating. This is why they test the back of the sinus for covid.
Here's a link for an inexpensive and easy to use sinus rinse system. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000RDZFZ0/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_0HKcFb5TQ63PJ
This is also why flus often spread more easily during cold weather, because our sinuses dry out, and they don't do such a good job at cleaning out the stuff that gets in there.

329,2020-07-19 21:09:00,Why the hell do they hate masks so much?,"
I would say that the stats aren't matching up with that. The news is currently only really giving us some new ""rise in new cases"" stories. If you compare the cases vs. deaths (you can toggle state, U.S. as a whole, deaths, and number of cases here) https://www.google.com/search?q=covid+stats&oq=covid+stats&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.1798j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
and https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm .
​
It closely matches the Flu https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/usmap.htm , and the Flu of course follows the patterns because http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2014/the-reason-for-the-season-why-flu-strikes-in-winter/ . Apply these to COVID, it'll be interesting to see the reason for the drop in deaths vs. increase in cases. More people are getting tested, that's for sure. If it's young healthy people that are out and about and getting tested, while the vulnerable are inside...well, we'll probably see a bump in the number of deaths in 3 or 4 months when everyone goes back inside.
​
The problem with COVID is of course the novelty of it (it's probably just getting to a few places even now), the lack of a vaccine, and a lot of scare tactics that are getting the predictable pushback (I'd blame the media for at least some of this). Is it serious? Yes. But why the mask thing (there isn't even a standard mask - your wife's pantyhose vs. a bandana vs. a surgery mask) is such a big deal, and not things like supplements (things to boost the immune system), handwashing (there's a good chance 90% of the public couldn't tell you why soap and water or an antibacterial is better, or the same), etc., you know...like we are supposed to do with the Flu each year, aren't a bigger deal is beyond me.

THE CORONA VIRUS by Dr. Lawrence Wilson © July 2020, LD Wilson Consultants, Inc. All information in this article is for educational purposes only. It is not intended as diagnosis, prescription, treatment or cure for any health condition.
At this time, our understanding of the Wuhon virus or Chinese virus (the proper name) is that it is a very mild illness for most people. However, the corrupt media and corrupt medical and political authorities have used it as an excuse to frighten people, to violate basic rights in a horrible way, and to damage the economies of the world. Writing about it brings great sadness for this author. - The illegality of business shutdowns, stay-at-home orders and mask orders. While it may seem uncaring to put this issue first, we must do so. The virus has killed some people and this is certainly unfortunate. However, the disregard and basically suspension of the US Constitution and others around the world is a far greater crime and tragedy. Creating an emergency and then using it to take away the basic rights of the people is one of the oldest tricks of tyrants. This is what is going on. This method has been used to destroy many nations in the past, and we fear the same is occurring today. If the virus is not enough, the world socialists and rogues will create more emergencies. These include fake police brutality, fake systemic racism, fake climate change, fake overpopulation, and who knows what is next. The goal is exactly the same! Frighten the people into giving up their rights and ignoring the constitutions. They want to substitute anarchy and dictatorship for orderly government. - The medical authorities. For the most part, they have done a terrible job – filled with fear-mongering, lies and corruption. For example, we have never heard the truth that 98% to 99% of people with the virus recover completely. We have also never heard the truth that simple fabric masks do not stop viruses from passing through them. Also, masks reduce oxygen intake, which is definitely harmful if one wishes to stay healthy. The medical authorities have also shown almost no interest in the unintended consequences of the illegal shutdown policies they advocate. These are items such as increased suicides, more drug and alcohol addiction, and other social problems that always accompany any economic downturn. One hospital in California, USA reported a year’s worth of suicides occurred just in one month. There has been incompetent or corrupt testing to inflate the number of cases, fake and twisted reporting of statistics, incompetent and possibly just murderous treatment of the sick, and lying on death certificates to inflate the death toll due to the virus. - Testing. A number of nurses and other hospital workers have reported that they sent in sterile swab samples, up to 10 at a time, and they all came back positive for the virus. This means the tests are either extremely inaccurate or they are fake, which we believe they are, in some places. The game is just to increase the statistics of how many people are infected. - The death toll. Hospitals were being told by the corrupt Centers For Disease Control in America to report anyone who dies with the virus as having died from the virus. This lying, we believe, has falsely inflated the death toll by at least 100% and probably more. On nurse reported that when two of her patients died of bronchitis (not the Chinese virus), she checked the next day and the death certificates had been changed to say that the patients died of the Chinese virus. One reason for this lying is that in America the government is paying hospitals $3900. and perhaps more for each Chinese virus case they treat. This is more pure corruption. - Killing patients. Several nurses reported that patients who entered the hospital with symptoms of the Chinese virus were mistreated and died unnecessarily. The use of ventilators can be deadly, but that is what the media and the US president and others have said is what is needed. It is all a lie or extremely incompetent medical practice. - Nutrition. We have not heard one word from the health authorities about the most powerful way to withstand any illness. It is to improve one’s diet and to take nutritional supplements. We believe that the communist Chinese leaders are giving their people natural vitamin A capsules. This is excellent to support the immune response. Meanwhile, for the past several years, natural vitamin A has not been available in the United States and Canada. We don’t know if the same is true in other Western nations. - The media’s coverage. This has been one-sided, extremely fear-mongering, often lying, with very little independent or investigative reporting and no balanced reporting. Also, most of the media, like the medical profession, has consistently downplayed the very costly and lethal side effects of the economic shutdowns. For example, our local news recently stated that “the hospitals are filling up”. They omitted to say that this is occurring because the hospitals are once again doing elective surgery. It is not due to the Chinese virus, which most hospitals report is only causing about 15% of their business at this time. They also recently warned us that the number of cases is climbing fast. They omit the fact that this is due to more testing, not more disease. The truth is, the death rate is dropping! The virus spreads easily, so millions have or will have contracted it. However, this is not a problem. In fact, it is a cause for celebration because it means that herd immunity is building. In short, media coverage is despicable and all the major television, radio and print media should be shut down for fraud (lying). This includes Fox News. - The citizen’s response. This is the saddest part, in our view. In most nations, especially the USA, most people just blindly obey their corrupt leaders. Very, very few protest the loss of their rights to work, to assemble, to worship freely and the right to walk around without wearing a mask that does not stop viruses. Many people seem brainwashed, meaning unable to think for themselves and see through the lies of the media and the medical authorities. It is truly sad. - The American state governors. With one exception, the American state governors have not hesitated to violate the First Amendment of the US Constitution and their state constitutions in the most grotesque manner. The First Amendment gives Citizens the right to assemble and the right to conduct business. Some US state governors have even attempted to ban the use of zinc and hydroxychloroquin, a very inexpensive and fairly safe therapeutic combination that takes care of the virus in almost 100% of cases. The governor of New York forced nursing homes to take in people suffering with the virus. This is insane unless he just wishes to kill people, which apparently he does. The governors have been informed about their illegal actions. We think they are all rogues and thoroughly corrupt. The corruption reaches all levels of the American and other governments of the world, including the president of the United States. We are concerned that perhaps the US president and the Democrats are playing a game of good cop, bad cop with the American people. This means the president pretends to be a friend of the people while the Democrats pretend to oppose him at every turn. However, the trick is that in reality, both the Democrats and the president are on the same side against the people. Otherwise, we believe the president would have his justice department shut down the media for fraud, stop all government aid to universities, fire thousands of ‘deep state’ government employees at once, arrest all Democratic legislators who oppose the border wall for treason, and send the military to Seattle and every other city to enforce the law where the local mayors and governors are not protecting the lives and property of their citizens. Some of this should have been done on the first day that the president took office. We are sorely disappointed in the conservative talk show hosts who are not pointing out that the president is going along with the illegal shutdowns and the lying by the medical people. This makes us believe that the talk show hosts are corrupt, as well. CONCLUSION We pray daily that more websites will tell the truth to the people in regard to the Chinese virus situation. So far, few are doing this. We believe we are one of them. Unless the people are informed and fight back, we foresee an end to the Western republics and the beginning of a new dark age of totalitarian government control. Actually, the US Constitution has been butchered for over 100 years. The present violation of rights is just the latest insult to this nation. We have purposely left out documentation of all we have said. This is because others are doing it well. For example, while we do not agree with Dr. Mercola about nutrition or exercise, his email newsletter at www.Mercola.com is documenting the virus deception quite well. Another good site is Robert F. Kennedy’s Children’s Health Defense. There are others, as well.

Not a Doctor, have you had your Vitamin B12 tested? I was exhausted for years and eventually we found it was a B12 deficiency which requires B12 injections (oral supplements are usually not good enough). I think B12 lowers your immune system a bit so you can get these minor infections while you have it. For example I developed warts on my hands around the time my tiredness began which I couldn't get rid of for the life of me. 10 years later when I finally got my B12 injections all the warts went within a month. Maybe it's contributing towards your toenail infection? Vitamin B12 testing is quite standard when you go Doctors for tiredness however in the UK they class deficiency as being under 150mmol whereas everywhere else in the world they class a deficiency as less than 300mmol. So if you are UK make sure you know your actual result and push for further tests if your in that awkward 150-300 range.

A solution for me to rid of outbreaks rapidly as they appear, & works faster than acyclovir, is to maintain myself on an immune boost supplement diet. Alpha Lipoc Acid, Vitamin C, Zinc, Vitamine D2, Probiotics, B-Complex supplement (all forms of vitamin b in one) & Omega 3 fish oil. Along with tea made from butterfly pea leaf to replace coffee, remove alcohol, stop consuming nicotine & processed foods. Sleep more regularly during ob to heal faster. Avoid stress as much as possible.
Life is better and with time the vaccine is not to far around the corner think of this virus as a common cold that a yearly shot can get rid of if you contract it again. Strange to think about but interesting nonetheless.

At this point, the safest thing is to assume you and everyone you live with has either been exposed or contracted the virus. I survived COVID. I was not on a ventilator but I was an essential worker and caught the virus early. If you take care of yourself you’ll be ok.
My suggestions (sorry on mobile)
Drink plenty of fluids, specially room temp water or warm beverages (My go to at the time was Prince of Peace ginger crystals)
If you can have a zinc supplement dropped off to help boost your immune system as well as vitamin D (you get plenty of C, take a vitamin that actually does something)
You’re going to need rest so take it easy.
If you lose your sense of smell and taste take advantage and go for nutrition over flavor
Last tip if you start to have labored breathing call 911. There are a lot of reports coming out recently that say hospital deaths are down because home deaths are up.
Once you’re recovered and testing negative multiple times you may have beat the virus. I now weekly donate plasma to help those on the ventilators since I had the virus
But please stay home and stay safe. Be well

Study 1:Low vitamin D levels were associated with a 5-fold increased risk for progression to tuberculosis.
If this is the case then what is the remedy? Mid to High dose Vitamin D3 as a supplement right? A RCT trial has already found that Vitamin D supplementation failed as a prophylactic, failed to prevent progression to Tuberculosis or reduce it compared to a placebo group?
Study 2: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with a decreased insulin release, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in experimental and epidemiological studies.
If Vitamin D3 supplementation did not reduce the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes as compared to a control group, what exact treatment potential does Vitamin D have in this case?
Study 3: Several epidemiological studies have suggested that individuals with low blood levels of vitamin D have increased risks of heart disease, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes.
Study 4: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is found to be associated with a wide range of pulmonary diseases, including viral and bacterial respiratory infections, asthma, and cancer.
I appreciate the studies you have linked, i have been opportuned to read most of them and most of these studies were pre-test justifications for some of the RCT studies i linked above. As with the other studies above, if supplemental Vitamin D did not show any effect in RCT studies in reducing the risk of developing these conditions, how do we judge its efficacy as a prophylactic or suitable immune modulator? There are 20 RCT studies looking at Vitamin D supplements for prophylactic use and as an immune modulator. We should know more soon about its actual efficacy but so far the pre-test probability is less than clear on its efficacy.

It may just be bad luck if I catch COVID, but if my luck is so terrible for me to be such a cautious person and still become ill, who knows what else terrible could happen. Suppose I recover, then what? My health will be permanently affected.
I simply cant let it out of my control. I will double or triple dose on immune supplements, I'll drink a gallon, two gallons of water, I can not let myself become ill . It wont be okay until I'm totally and completely safe, no matter what it takes. And if I catch COVID anyways, then I will have to die.

My approach to COVID is the same. When it’s ready, I want to be ready. The risk (even if slim) of harming others, or being severely ill or dying myself is not worth it.

No, aspirin is not recommended because of how it affects blood flow.
To clear it up, in France, the health agencies have recommended to not take aspirin, ibuprofen and other anti-inflammatory drugs, preventive tylenol (and put it on prescription only, it no longer can be found off the counter) and recommend 3g per day maximum (edit, for tylenol, when it used to be 4g per 24hours).

To evaluate the efficacy of existing vaccines against infection with SHC014-MA15, we vaccinated aged mice with double-inactivated whole SARS-CoV (DIV). Previous work showed that DIV could neutralize and protect young mice from challenge with a homologous virus14; however, the vaccine failed to protect aged animals in which augmented immune pathology was also observed, indicating the possibility of the animals being harmed because of the vaccination15. Here we found that DIV did not provide protection from challenge with SHC014-MA15 with regards to weight loss or viral titer (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). Consistent with a previous report with other heterologous group 2b CoVs15, serum from DIV-vaccinated, aged mice also failed to neutralize SHC014-MA15 (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Notably, DIV vaccination resulted in robust immune pathology (Supplementary Table 4) and eosinophilia (Supplementary Fig. 5d–f). Together, these results confirm that the DIV vaccine would not be protective against infection with SHC014 and could possibly augment disease in the aged vaccinated group.

Vitamin D supplements are helpful but they do not have the same whole-health benefit that the sun has. You don't have to fry for 3 hours in the sun every day, but even 10-15 minutes of sun daily can be really helpful.
If we're just focusing on vitamin D, research has shown that supplements do not always have the same immune protective effect that real sun has.
If we're talking whole-health, the sun also has benefits for other systems like the nitric oxide pathway which helps reduce stress.

Unfortunately is a poorly understood disease that can have many debilitating symptoms. If you catch it quickly antibiotics for a few weeks might do the trick, but a small percentage of people that have gone undiagnosed for a while, don't see improvement unless treated for months / years. It's a combination of antibiotics, immune support, herbal supplements, pain management, etc. The problem is that lyme tests are not very accurate so testing negative once is not not necessary an indication of not having the disease (i was ""lucky"" that they did find the bacteria swimming in my blood, so diagnosis was certain) and there is a lot of controversy and debate between ""chronic lyme"" (you still have it and doesn't go away) and ""post treatment lyme disease syndrome"" (you may have killed the bacteria but your body continue to act like it's sick). Idk if its chronic lyme or post treatment lyme but I've been on antibiotics and many others meds for over a year both lyme and babesiosis (another tick born disease). Besides the usual symptoms (muscle pain, joint pain, fatigue) I also experienced shortness of breath, chest pain, tachycardia, lightheadedness, brain fog, memory issues, fainting, cold sweat, anxiety, nerve pain, problem recalling words, disassociation, and was barely sleeping because the pain and symptoms would wake me up 20 times a night. Eventually being sick for so long caused my body to go a bit haywire and developed Mast Cell Activation Syndrome and get head to toe hives, so now I'm treating that too. Besides medications I recently started a program to retrain my brain to not think and act like its sick which supposedly will help. Sounds a bit woo woo but I'll try anything at this point.
As for pain management I've been working on that before I was diagnosed, I go to the chiropractor regularly, get massages every 3-4 weeks, physical therapy, and will start acupuncture soon to see if it helps.

"
375,2020-11-19 21:31:00,Why do some vaccines require a booster shot a few weeks later after the first one?,"
To add to this:
The antibodies are passed via the placenta in the third trimester, so premature babies are much more at risk from disease upon birth.
Antibodies are also passed through breast milk, and the thicker, yellowish milk that the mother creates during the first few weeks after birth is particularly high in antibodies. So breast-fed babies have passive immunity for longer, and are able to receive new antibodies that the mother creates after birth. The really cool thing is that through breast feeding, the mother can detect viruses present in the baby’s saliva (such as coronaviruses), and supplement the baby’s own immune response by creating antibodies which are then passed to the baby through milk, even though the mother never had the disease herself.
Anti-vaxxers may be saving up another nasty issue: Most of them were actually vaccinated against some pretty terrible diseases, which means that their children had some (short-lasting) protection at birth; But if herd immunity is enough that their kids don’t catch them, then eventually their grandchildren will be born with no passive immunity, and vaccinations may not be able to be given immediately, so coupled with the declining herd immunity the same anti-vaxxers will have caused by then, the fatality rate amongst newborn babies could see a steep uptick.

Yes, rosemary is also a COX-2 inhibitor.
The immune system impairing effects from COX-2 inhibitors can last for several days after discontinuing them.
Stopping all COX-2 inhibitors now could mean the difference between having to go to the hospital or not for some people.
LOW DOSE aspirin uniquely does not have this negative effect on the immune system.
Although quercetin is a COX-2 inhibitor, it has separate mechanisms to reduce cytokine expression, so it's probably not a problem like other COX-2 inhibitors are. The lists from France that I've seen appropriately did not include quercetin.
COX-2 inhibitors impairing the immune system is something humanity has known about for many years and it's criminal that only France is taking this sort of action. Some other medical professionals elsewhere are even trying to gaslight and deny the science.

390,2020-11-19 15:55:00,Simply tips for COVID,"
As someone who has had COVID and lives in a state (NYC) that was devastated by it I wanted to share some simply way to help from getting infected and/or spreading it
​
Sounds simply but always wear your mask! When I say always I mean 90% of the time, yeah maybe don't sleep with one on but wearing one constantly regardless of the situation helps train you to always put one on, stop touching your face, and helps prevent you from constantly handling the mask which can lead to cross contamination Stop wearing you mask bellow you nose and/or chin, you can breath and we all can hear you perfectly fine Carry a small thing of sanitizer to not only constantly sanitize your hands but also wipe down surfaces or things like credit cards. Remember you must rub most sanitizers until your hands become dry or tacky
Wear glasses, goggles, face shields, or any other kind of eye protection with a mask. It's clear that COVID can become airborne so it's important to protect our eyes. While glasses don't offer an amazing seal they do protect you from COVID better than being bare eyed. If you think you are 6 feet apart think again. Most people forget what true 6"" apart means, plus studies have found that coughs and sneezes can travel way beyond this to more like 20+ feet.
Consider anything that has not been sanitized or aged (5+ days of non exposure) to be possibly be contaminated. While infection from touching surfaces remains low compared infection via droplets, the possibility of touching an item or surface and becoming infected is real. Either wipe/spray items or packages (NOT FOOD), or let them age for 5 days depending on the surface Wear a mask in a car. You should be always wearing a mask in a car when you are with people when you don't know their COVID status. I don't want to be that guy but I would say even wear one with family or close friends. People's COVID status can change at a whim and sometimes even testing can miss this. I would also suggest cracking a window or your moonroof for ventilation of nicer days If you wear cloth masks make sure they are two ply but that you are cleaning them properly. try and wash either by hand or in a delicate bag in your machine on low. Always air dry your cloth masks. Never wear them when wet or even damp. Never reuse cloth masks. Don't hoard but make sure you have at least 90 days worth of masks, sanitizers, food and water for you and your family. The prospect of a 2nd shutdown is real, whether or not it's as bad as the 1st one is to be seen, but no one wants to be in a situation where they are paying $50 for a pack 50 surgical masks and stores without toilet paper like back in March If you have the space plan for a isolation room. Some people don't have the luxury of a spare room for a person to isolate, so that gets very difficult, but if you do make a plan incase someone gets sick Buy a window fan and air purifier. Both are great for daily use but also are great in setting up isolation rooms Get tested. Ideally you would get tested once a week regardless of your presumed status but if you are even doubting for second if you could have come into contact with someone with COVID or you have COVID symptoms get tested!
PCR tests are the gold standard tests. The results do take longer but they statically are more reliable.
If you believe you have been exposed the virus can take anywhere from 2-14 days to develop. You may or may NOT show any form of symptoms. Try and wait 5 days from when you believe you were exposed to be tested for best results. In the meantime isolate! If you test negative but have symptoms, assume you have it and isolate until you are symptom free or ideally test again and have multiple negative tests Children should be following the same protocol or masks, socially distancing, and sanitizing. Yes COVID seems to be effecting younger adults or children less But they can spread the infection to weaker demographics.
Get your flu shot! This does NOT stop you from getting COVID19 or even the flu however if can lessen you flu symptoms. It is possible to have the flu and COVID 19 at the same time. Less people with the flu means less people inundating the healthcare system
Eat well. Make sure to be getting you Vitamin C D and Zinc and other immune boosting vitamins and supplements Get fresh air and get exercising. Lockdown fatigue is real and the winter is only going to make it harder. When safely possibly get outside and be active Indoor dining even if there it's semi outside or well ventilated is very risky during flu season and the current status of COVID If you exercise you still need to wear a mask and socially distance unless you play a professional sport and constant get tested and have a hole team able to contract trace for you

This is what they recommend yes.
But then again in France the minsitry of health and health agencies have decided to consider someone to be treated as sick from covid only if showing symptoms. It's not that simple but the key is symptoms. So like if you are asymptomatic but contact of a positive case and you get tested as positive, then you are considered sick from covid and to be isolated.
But on the other hand you cannot get a test if you're asymptomatic and not a referenced contact of someone who tested positive recently.
So they are focusing on ""proven"" patients either by symptoms of contact tracing.
With that in mind, it makes sense to only stop taking them if you're symptomatic.
But my take is if you or the people living with you have recent contact with people that may be shedding the virus, wether they are symptomatic or not, it may be best to stop taking them preventively.
You're fine taking them if you're hunkered down though and isolated.
I've browsed through the study and at some point they say taking ibuprofene 2-4 days before going to hospital resulted in dramatic worsening of respiratory issues (in something else than covid tbut that affects the same organs).
So I'll just eat organic WFPB and let that do its magic (boost energy like you wouldn't believe)

These people ride in a lot of “capitalism sucks...but over here under the exact same profit motives with a dramatically more exploitative model it doesn’t, Right!?!!” When DSHEA(dietary supplement health enforcement act) passed, the newly deregulated supplement industry got trampled by predatory MLM’s that, with a need to distinguish themselves, obsessively pushed the broadly “anti conventional medicine, anti pharma, anti capitalist medicine” But, Can never seem to explain why simply being a for profit capitalist supplement company would make them in any way immune to these corrupting profit motives. It makes no sense. If there was money to be made the dams capitalists that are squeezing is for pharmaceuticals would do the same for “supplements”, there’s not a secret boundary that prevents them. It makes no goddamn sense.

Dear Governor
I'm a small business owner who has fought tirelessly through this epidmenic. As an independent restaurant, I have done everything possible to stay afloat. But we are also a wellness company. We are producing immune-boosting food for the community including immunity kits for frontline workers. Food filled with wholesome raw ingredients designed to boost immune systems and reduce inflammation. Why is the government teaching citizens to manage sickness and play an offense game with sickess vs be proactive and defensive: Take Vitamin C, D, Garlic Pills, Zinc, NAC, Camu Camu-all amazing supplements to boost immune system + to eat nutrient dense foods. This to me, is a missed opportunity to teach citizens to improve their health, provide a defense and a not gamble it and/or manage disease. Wellness isn't produced or practiced by big pharma but simple practices have a huge benefit to health. We are killing small businesses when we could be teaching people how to kill and prevent disease and live happier, better quality lives simply with better wellness practices.

If you don’t mind the correction, terrain theory is actually an altogether different theory. The miasma theory came before germ theory, as it was theorized that “bad air” was the cause of all disease. Terrain theory states that pathogens are a natural part of the ecosystem and that as long as we are taking care of ourselves, we should let our immune systems fight off the pathogens naturally without the need for supplement.

The french agency ANSES, which is a little like the US FDA, recommends to not take any supplements that could mingle with the immune system or mimicks aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs.
So it would be best to avoid taking :
Willow
meadowsweet
devil's claw
turmeric
Echinacea
birch
poplars
Liquorice
Boswellia
Commiphora
They recommend to stop taking them, if you're taking them preventively, as soon as you're experiencing the first symptoms of covid, and to call your doctor and discuss which treatment you can continue if they were prescribed.
I've suspended my echinacea intake, until my husband is cleared.
The link at the bottom of the page I've linked to, goes to a study that shows how the respiratory affections are dramatically worsened by even short preventive intake of those plants or anti-inflammatory pills, or aspirin. It affects the survival rate.

Have hashimotos, can confirm that it can severely impact energy levels and memory if it's not being managed. Not a doctor, and everyone is different soo YMMV, but I do have one add-on: if you're struggling with having abnormally low energy and symptoms that might present similar to depression: get your vitamin d levels checked (esp in winter) and work on your gut health. Most of your immune system - and much of your serotonin production - are housed in your gut Probiotics, fiber, foods that fight inflammation and promote healthy immune system (ginger, yogurt, fermented foods, kombucha, garlic, onions), and supplements that support immune/gut health can make a HUGE difference. Even with medication bringing me to nearly perfect thyroid levels, adjusting diet and adding in supplements to support my digestive health has made an insane difference on my energy levels and my overall mood
In the end, it may turn out that you do actually have depression that has no obvious medical cause and these fixes won't work, but they're worth exploring just in case

Well, it's always great to get your full daily dosage of vitamins, and we know vitamin D is important for the immune system, but just taking supplements isn't going to help lessen the symptoms. If you already are eating healthy, there's little need for vitamin D supplements. On the contrary, taking too much vitamin D can be detrimental to your health as well - and this risk is higher for children.
A lot of the studies out there on vitamin D and COVID are observational and mostly rely on correlation - there's no causative link yet, or at least I've not read any studies that would go that far, that vitamin D prevents or lessens the effects of COVID. Even then, it's always a good idea to keep getting your daily vitamins and minerals via a healthy diet with supplements as a tool to reach your daily intake.

For the most part, that is correct, however there are noted benefits to taking larger than the minimum necessary of a handful of vitamins and nutrients, with a few exceptions of course. I would strongly advise against taking Vitamin A and E unless deficient of either due to potential toxicities. On the other hand, due to Western diets and lack of sun exposure, most people tend to be at least moderately deficient of Vitamin D without even knowing it. Those I listed are GRAS with low or zero toxicity at normal doses, and potentially substantial added benefits when taken in supplement form, to one's immunity for example.

cancer and autoimmunity are supposedly on opposite ends of the spectrum, so could ""anti cancer"" products also promote autoimmunity?

but what about other immune stimulants like vitamin K2, Zinc, vit C, ashwagandha, echinea, pine bark, olive leaf extract, and the numerous other immune stimulant supplements? maybe the herbs are safer and more balanced in this regard compared to isolated vitamins like C, K2, iodine, zinc, etc?
"
433,2020-04-11 18:53:00,"immunostimulatory vs immunomodulatory supplements, impact on immune system","
Many supplements have immunostimulatory properties, some have immunomodulatory properties, and some have immunosuppressive properties. I'm trying to get an idea of which category some of these supplements fall into. I have found that the strong immunostimulatory supplements can both create, or exacerbate autoimmune disease, so in the long run these supplements could be very harmful, unless it is something like low doses of a pollen or herb you could maybe adapt to over time.
strong immunostimulants:
ashwagandha ksm 66
potassium iodide/iodine
dhea, pregnenolone, 7 keto dhea
tribulus terrestris
echinea?
possibly vitamin C, vitamin K2 Mk4, zinc?
possibly pine pollen, bee pollen, Pau D arco (lapacho), emodin (cascara), horny goat weed, tongkat ali?
whey protein powder, dairy products?
​
immunomodulatory:
vitamin D3
possibly caffeine, aspirin, vitamin E, selenium?
possibly yohimbine hcl, yohimbe, black cumin seed oil?
​
immunosuppressive:
omega 3 and omega 6?
​
neutral:
saturated fats, omega 7 and omega 9 fatty acids, meat proteins?
​
uncertain:
vitamin A, B vitamins, iron, copper, choline bitartrate, PQQ, agmatine sulfate, phosphatidylserine, uridine monophosphate, bacopa monieri, mangosteen, EGCG, citrus bioflavonoids, HMB, glycine, creatine, beta alanine, taurine, betaine trimethylglycine, niacinamide, biotin, olive leaf extract, apple cider vinegar, theanine, inositol, PABA.
​
from what ive observed and read, if you take too strong an immunostimulant in an improper dose, you can create/exacerbate autoimmune disease. most likely, if you combine several weaker immunostimulants in improper doses, you could also create the same. if you take too many immuno suppressives, you could cause immunodeficiency. the immunomodulatory substances seem to be the safest as far as immune system impact is concerned.
​
I'm particularly interested in the impact of things like vitamin C, vitamin K2 MK4, zinc, Pau D Arco, horny goat weed, aspirin, caffeine, vitamin E, yohimbine, yohimbe, vitamin A, creatine, beta alanine, taurine, choline, betaine, olive leaf extract, apple cider vinegar, theanine, PQQ, Coq10, phosphatidylserine, uridine monophosphate, lapachone, emodin, niacinamide, b12, b9, b2, on the immune system. Some of these supplements are very popular, some are becoming increasingly popular due to COVID. A common link I have noticed is that products known to lower cortisol levels (ashwaganda) tend to also be immunostimulants and possibly pro inflammatory.

You need to be able to identify early infections, quarantine them and do contact tracing. Antibody tests can supplement by identifying non-sick people who have built up immunity, and provide confirmation of suspected infections after the onset of symptoms.

Thanks for the response mate, really really interesting. There's some weird parallels too - I also suffer(ed) with suspected sebhorric dermatitis. This coincided with really sudden hair loss just under 2 years ago (this led to a dermatologist mistakenly diagnosing me originally with an autoimmune condition which causes alopecia). I fixed this through diet and supplements to reduce inflammation - reduce the inflammation = reduce the hair loss. I'm a firm believer in this. Vitamin D3 is a daily supplement for me also along with a lot of others too. I'm not going to go down the fin route but respect people have just got a different view on this.

Yeah... doctors aren't scientists, and those are bought by big pharma to twist results and statistics to sell drugs... I wanted to become a medical researcher... Instead I became a cripple and my life was on the line. I used my own body for research... and because my very life depended on it, not profits from my employer, I found the real cure. Doctors who did lost their licence and were even assassinated.
Because the cure denounce our entire way of living and discredit the entire medical drug system.
The cure is to give your body what it needs to cure himself. And most of it is vitamin C.
Apples are a better cure than dope. Everyone knows it... ""an apple a day keeps the doctor a day""... because of the vitamin C... in bone broth too (collagen)... Lack of vitamin C causes every single organ to shut down and break, and the mood goes to hell along with it. Collagen is like the glue holding every cells together...
But you will never hear about it in the recommendations, because they're not based on health and to boost the immune system... but on control, fear and killing enemies. You can't poison the body and make it healthier, that's like nuking your entire country to kill a terrorist.
But you can give bazookas to the police, you can give vitamin C supplements to your immune system...
I bet my life on it. And I'm still here even though I'm considered a cripple for life. In china they gave intravenous vitamin C and saved the sickest people... Here if you mention it... you get ridiculed... people would rather die than stop believing in the medical dogma... because they can't face the fact that, NO, they aren't special snowflakes with the whole world wanting to fulfil their needs better than they want to do for themselves... they're not special... no one want to help them... they're all alone on their own with the whole world lying and trying to screw them for money...
Having a terrible mother and assault helped me take responsibility for my own life... The world was always a terrifying place for me. Not from the viruses that I kept catching... but the heartlessness and stupidity of the people claiming to help me out of love...
If someone gets assaulted by a criminal, they get treated worse than the criminal... locked up without a trial, drugged until they're brain damaged, chemical lobotomy, electrochocs, tied up all day... denied validation... medical care... dismissed as a person, blamed, told that their personality is a disease... killed by toxic drugs side effects... even child molester killers aren't treated that badly.
Corporations don't want your own good, the more they claim they do, the more they want to enslave and exploit the weak. Damn heartless psychopaths.

While I do appreciate the fact that I’m still employed, it’s been hard working through the pandemic and shut downs.
It has affected the schedules of vendors and equipment technical representatives so we have to work around it. It has affected the speed of equipment and parts coming in, and we have to work around it...
We’re short on disinfectants. We’re short on staff because if their family members are showing symptoms, they have to stay home.
Grocery stores close by the time we’re off work. So we have to get our grocery shopping done in the morning before work. We also have to keep a weeks supply of food in our fridge because you never know when you get the call that you’ve been in close contact with someone who tested positive and you can’t leave the house.
I’m exhausted. I also have no sick leave. I don’t come to work, I don’t get paid.
It’s a physical job and I have to space out the hard physical stuff so I don’t stress my immune system too much. I’ve been drinking protein shakes and taking supplements to help my muscles heal after a long day.

It sucks, especially the impaired breathing. But the best thing you can do is mentally fight this and then treat this virus. So that means rest, lots of fluids and as others have discovered, warm fluids tend to work best. I took immune boosting supplements. They could have had a placebo effect on me, but I took them anyway. Vitamins A-E, Zinc, Magnesium for the D, Selenium, Omega 3’s and avoided ibuprofen because it suppresses the immune system. I did diaphragmatic breathing exercises to help get oxygen and did COPD therapy (look it up) to dry to get mucus out. Be patient and diligent and you will get better. For me on my worst day I thought I was going to die and then it went away like it was lifted away. All at once.

461,2020-04-25 01:52:00,Analysis on Vitamin D and COVID-19 Observational Study - Chris Masterjohn,"
Today I was made aware of a preprint* that was most recently revised yesterday with specific data on vitamin D status. This is the first observational study that has, to my knowledge, addressed how vitamin D levels correlate with COVID-19 severity.
A researcher from the Philippines used the data from three South Asian hospitals to examine the association between 25(OH)D, the principal marker of vitamin D status, and severity of COVID-19 among 212 confirmed cases. The Results
The categories of COVID-19 severity were defined as follows:
Mild: no pneumonia Ordinary: pneumonia, fever, and respiratory symptoms Severe: hypoxia and respiratory distress Critical: respiratory failure requiring intensive care
In ng/mL (multiply by 2.5 to get nmol/L), the average 25(OH)D among the cases was 23.8.
Among mild cases, it was, on average, 31.2; among ordinary cases, it was 27.4; among severe cases, it was 21.2; among critical cases, it was 17.1.
Vitamin D status was also categorized as follows:
Normal: >30 Insufficient: 21-29 Deficient: <20
Only 26% of the cases had 25(OH)D in the normal range, and virtually all of them (86%) had a mild outcome. A small proportion (7.3%) had an ordinary outcome, and smaller proportions had severe (3.6%) or critical (3.6%) outcomes.
Just over a third (38%) had 25(OH)D in the insufficient range, and only one of them (1.3%) had a mild outcome. Almost half of them (44%) had an ordinary outcome. Just over a quarter (29%) had a severe outcome, and another quarter (26%) had a critical outcome.
Just over a third (36%) had 25(OH)D in the deficient range, and their distribution was pushed further toward severe and critical outcomes. Only one patient (1.4%) had a mild outcome, while 26% had an ordinary outcome, 40% had a severe outcome, and 33% had a critical outcome. What Is the Optimal Level of 25(OH)D?
This study is small, cross-sectional rather than prospective, and non-randomized, and therefore should not be used to infer cause and effect relationships.
However, if we take the numbers at face value, what 25(OH)D is associated with the best outcome?
The mild cases had a mean 25(OH)D of 31.2, with a standard deviation of 1.08. Assuming a nicely shaped bell curve for the distribution, this suggests that 95% of all mild cases fell between the mean plus or minus two standard deviations, which is between 29 and 33.4.
2.5% of people would fall outside the distribution on the high end, and another 2.5% would fall outside it on the low end. So, two things are true:
97.5% of mild cases had 25(OH)D that was 29 ng/mL or higher. 97.5% of mild cases had 25(OH)D that was 33.4 ng/mL or lower.
This study provides no information on how vitamin D levels above 34 ng/mL associate with COVID-19 severity. We cannot rule out a U-shaped curve, where higher levels associate with greater severity, at this time. Does This Represent Cause and Effect?
The relationship between vitamin D and inflammation is a two-way street. The activation of immune cells causes them to use up vitamin D by converting it to its active hormonal form, calcitriol. Inflammation thus decreases 25(OH)D. Nevertheless, the fact that immune cells activate vitamin D for their own purposes means that vitamin D is essential to immune function.
Whenever we see an association between low vitamin D and infectious disease or immune dysfunction, it is possible that the disease itself is depleting the vitamin D. It is also possible that low vitamin D as a result of low dietary intake or low sunshine exposure led to the disease.
If the disease caused the low vitamin D in the first place, this doesn't rule out the possibility that vitamin D supplementation would improve the course of the disease. It may in some cases, and may not in others.
Let's consider some cause-and-effect hypotheses. What Might Explain These Results?
As I noted previously, the best predictors of severity are low lymphocytes and high interleukin-6 (IL-6). As I noted in the elderberry post, one study identified the strongest predictor as the ratio of neutrophils to CD4 and CD8 T cells, which are subsets of lymphocytes. We don't know for sure that altering these markers will alter the course of the disease, but it's a very reasonable hypothesis that it would.
What do we know about how vitamin D impacts these markers in other contexts? Vitamin D and Lymphocytes
In the context of HIV, vitamin D deficiency is associated with lower CD4 T cell counts in some but not all studies. However, vitamin D supplementation does not raise the CD4 T cell counts (here, here, or here).
Similarly, in postmenopausal women, vitamin D does not alter lymphocyte counts.
However, in the context of tuberculosis, vitamin D supplementation increases lymphocyte counts, and in adolescent girls, vitamin D decreases the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes.
That at least one study in HIV found that low vitamin D levels correlate with low CD4T cells, yet at least three studies found that supplementation had no effect, shows that correlations between vitamin D and immune parameters do not always represent cause-and-effect relationships, and could represent the immune dysfunction itself lowering both vitamin D status and CD4 T cells. This warrants caution for assuming that vitamin D supplementation could help with COVID-19.
On the other hand, the fact that vitamin D supplementation does increase lymphocytes and does decrease the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in some contexts makes it plausible that vitamin D might do those same things in the context of COVID-19, which might reduce the severity of the disease. Vitamin D and IL-6
A meta-analysis of four trials in middle-age and older-adults found no effect of vitamin D on IL-6. Another meta-analysis reported four studies that all found no effect of vitamin D on IL-6 in hemodialysis patients. Another pooled the results of eight studies and reported no effect in obese and overweight subjects. In diabetes, three out of five studies found that IL-6 was lower in vitamin D supplementation groups than in controls, but statistical significance was only achieved in one study, and when the results of the five studies were pooled together, they were not statistically significant.
However, in heart failure, vitamin D supplementation reduced IL-6 in one trial but not another. In diabetic kidney disease, vitamin D supplementation reduced IL-6 in all three trials.
Intramuscular injection of 300,000 IU vitamin D reduced IL-6 in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. Since COVID-19 causes pneumonia, this is arguably the context that is most relevant to COVID-19. The Most Likely Explanation
It seems as though vitamin D has very little impact on IL-6 in studies of chronic illness where the inflammation is typically moderate, while it sometimes has a dramatic effect on IL-6 in severe or acute inflammatory conditions.
Since IL-6 can rise 10- or 20-fold higher than normal levels in COVID-19, it seems quite likely that vitamin D could help keep it closer to normal levels. Since IL-6 could be playing a direct role in hypoxemia and respiratory failure, that makes a strong case for testing whether vitamin D could prevent the disease from progressing in severity.
This seems like a stronger case than vitamin D altering lymphocyte counts, because the effect of vitamin D on IL-6 appears to depend on the severity of the inflammatory disease. By contrast, there a number of negative studies for vitamin D and lymphocyte counts in HIV, where lymphocyte counts really matter, and the contexts where it helps (tuberculosis, adolescent girls but not postmenopausal women) do not seem to have a consistent pattern.
However, these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and there is no reason to assume vitamin D is limited to one important role. Should Vitamin D Be Taken Preventatively, or in Response to COVID-19?
In principle, I find it most likely that vitamin D exerts most of its protection after someone becomes ill with COVID-19. In the IL-6 study I reviewed, IL-6 appeared to spike very early in the disease far higher than anyone would have normally, but it was the peak IL-6 reached over the course of the disease that determined whether someone wound up on a ventilator. Since vitamin D seems to reduce IL-6 in acute and severe cases, but not in chronic and moderate cases, I believe maintaining vitamin D levels during the active infection is what is likely to restrain IL-6 and possibly prevent the progression to a severe outcome.
We still do not have any data on how vitamin D impacts the likelihood someone will become infected or symptomatic.
It is entirely possible that a risk factor can protect against infection but promote severe progression, or increase the likelihood of infection while preventing severe progression.
For example, in COVID-19 and the Smoking Paradox, I hypothesized that smoking may decrease infection risk because of the toxic effects that free radicals in the smoke could have on the virus, while promoting disease severity by increasing ACE2 and thus increasing viral load.
Conversely, vitamin D may increase infection risk because it increases ACE2 but does not, unlike smoke, have directly toxic effects on the virus. It may, further, increase viral load, since the ACE2 would be expected to seed exponential growth of the virus. However, if it also restrains IL-6 from reaching extremely high levels, it may ultimately prevent the worst manifestations of the disease.
Nevertheless, given that the 25(OH)D levels associated with a mild outcome (29-34 ng/mL) are consistent with those needed to maximize the absorption of calcium from food, protect bone health, and minimize all-cause mortality (as I pointed out in my response to Rhonda Patrick), it seems wisest and simplest to me to keep 25(OH)D in this range prophylactically.
With that said, I strongly recommend that physicians involved in COVID-19 treatment test and publish the effect of correcting low 25(OH)D on COVID-19 outcomes. How I am Changing My Position
My position that vitamin D may raise ACE2, which may increase the risk of getting COVID-19, remains the same. I remain concerned that high vitamin D levels may, through this mechanism, make COVID-19 outcomes more severe.
However, I believe this new data justifies putting a tentative floor of 29 ng/mL on the acceptable 25(OH)D level during the COVID-19 crisis.
Rather than using food and sunshine as a general default, I think the best default is to shoot for a 25(OH)D of 30 ng/mL. The average person needs 900 IU/d to achieve this, and 97.5% of people need no more than 1700 IU to achieve this. You can test your level with a home kit, such as those offered by Grassroots Health.
I do not recommend shooting for higher levels and I remain concerned that higher levels could be associated with higher risk through a U-shaped curve.
I plan to update The Food and Supplement Guide for the Coronavirus tomorrow to reflect this. If you purchase it now, you will get the current version now and will then get the free update immediately upon release. The Bottom Line
Vitamin D levels below 29-34 ng/mL are associated with more severe COVID-19 outcomes. This is based on a small, cross-sectional, observational study, and could easily be revised by data that comes in later.
We do not know if higher levels are also associated with more severe disease through a U-shaped curve, and we currently have no data on how vitamin D impacts the risk of getting COVID-19 in the first place.
Although we cannot be sure that vitamin D is protective, the most likely explanation for this is that maintaining healthy vitamin D levels restrains the massive increase in IL-6 that may occur in severe cases of COVID-19, and thereby stops IL-6 from contributing to the increased blood clotting and low oxygen levels that can render the disease course critical or deadly.
My position is that we should maintain 25(OH)D levels close to 30 ng/mL.

There's a lot of good stuff tied to running and exercise that goes beyond the surface. In my case I've dropped 100lbs from a drastic diet change. In order to accomplish that I had to overhaul my entire lifestyle and mindsets. I had to kill a lot of old habits and start building some self-discipline. Running regularly is helping me set goals, stick to a routine, and teaching me to do things I don't feel like doing - which was the mindset I needed to get into to stop weighing over 300lbs with serious health risks. It's been incredible so far. People can laugh all they want at runners saying its good for mental health, but it truly is in ways I don't expect anyone to understand until they've experienced it. I want them to just know that there's a lot more tied to it than just moving fast. I'm sorry runners aren't being more creative with where they're running ATM, but this situation is new to everyone.

Ummm, anything in large amounts will cause harm to the body. Literally everything is toxic if the dosage is too high, even water. The prescriptions doctors give is designed to be a non-toxic dosage (many doctors lean on overprescribing to an extent, but not to a toxic degree). The dosage is always tested beforehand by the CDC.
Also, taking excess vitamin C and D does not make your immune system stronger, neither do zinc supplements. You just end up pissing out the excess without it being processed by your body. If you have a normal diet (EAT YOUR VEGETABLES), exercise regularly, get plenty of sleep, and don't do obviously unhealthy things (drinking, taking drugs, etc...), then your immune system is likely working at maximum capacity (exceptions go to those who are immuno-compromised, but eating vitamin C and D, or zinc won't help you).
To give a metaphor, if you want a construction project to be done sooner, you can't just deliver more materials and expect it to be done sooner. Most people get enough vitamin C and D just from eating a normal or semi-normal diet, eating more of it isn't going to make anything better.
Also, making your immune system stronger doesn't prevent you from getting the virus, it just makes the response time and recovery time faster, but that's nitpicking. I like nitpicking.

And yes, people who are deficient in things totally benefit from taking vitamins and supliments, but people who dont need them are just paying for expensive pee, and to imply they help EVERYONE is really just wrong. Also, you can have actual scientists working in a lab and still have biased studies. They could also be coming out with true information, but the thing about scientific research, is that one study by one person/group/lab isn't nearly as trustworthy as many studies done by many different people/groups/labs with different affiliations. Because there is lots of contradictory ""true"" research done by real scientists in real labs, who are just cherry picking data, choosing to ignore studies that don't go the way they want, and interpreting things in the way that makes them look best. The information may technically be true, but only under certain circumstances, etc. I take an $11 multi + beauty vitamin from the drugstore, as reccomended by my nutritionist (the multi was reccomended, the + beauty was my choice, but it's all in one so I'm not doubling doses in ways that will make things less effective or are useless), and I saw results from that.

466,2020-04-24 00:45:00,5 REASONS TO TAKE ASTAXANTHIN EVERY DAY,"
Most people know Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant...
But did you know that Astaxanthin is 6,000 times stronger than vitamin C?
That’s right, Astaxanthin is one of the world's most potent antioxidants and has a wide range of health benefits that we’ll discuss on this page.
But first…
What Exactly Is Astaxanthin
Astaxanthin is a potent antioxidant carotenoid produced naturally in freshwater microalgae. Carotenoids are what give a bright orange or red look to fruits, animals (like Salmon!) and vegetables.
One of Astaxanthin's most noticeable traits is its ability to maintain it’s antioxidant benefits throughout its metabolization. Which means, unlike other vitamins and minerals Astaxanthin never converts to a “pro-oxidant'' so you can drastically reduce oxidative stress within your body!
Here’s Why You Should Take Astaxanthin Every Day
1. Reduces Oxidative Stress
Astaxanthin is known to be 6,000 times more potent than vitamin C when comparing its antioxidant properties. Which means you’ll be strengthening your immune system, repairing damaged cells, neutralizing free radicals and feeling amazing as a result of taking this unique supplement every day.
2. Increases Your Cardiovascular Health
Scientific studies have shown that Astaxanthin supplementation caused a decrease in triglycerides. Triglycerides are lipids that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Not only that, but Astaxanthin supplementation has shown to significantly increase HDL cholesterol levels, which as you know… is great for your cardiovascular health!
HDL Cholesterol is what hunts throughout your bloodstream to remove dangerous LDL Cholesterol!
3. Decreases Joint Pain
Joint pain can affect the best of us. From young gym junkies to those with arthritis, living with joint pain can be excruciating, to say the least. Due to Astaxathin’s potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, it can quickly relieve the pain of even the most aching joints.
4. Protect & Repairs Hair, Skin, Nails & Eyes!
Studies show that Astaxanthin can protect your skin against harmful UV rays and some studies even show that this amazing natural antioxidant can slow down the aging process!
If you care about having healthy, vibrant looking skin, supplementing Astaxanthin is a must!
5. Boosts Your Immune System
Now more than ever ensuring your immune system has the best possible chance to fight off infections and viruses is an absolute must. What’s great is that multiple studies have shown supplementing Astaxanthin increases your immune response!
Here’s Where You Can Get Astaxanthin
Unfortunately, your body cannot create Astaxanthin on its own. The good news is that you can get Astaxanthin in our immune system boosting supplement, X-Factor.
X-Factor contains 8mg of Astaxanthin per serving (from haematococcus pluvialis algae!) and other amazing nutrients like Vitamin E (an amazing immune system booster!), Vitamin A (great for your skin and overall health!) and Luiten! (another powerful anti-inflammatory ingredient!).

What changes have you made recently that you feel are a little out of the ordinary for you? Have you been eating different foods, trying different products? Also I would suggest Curology. I had acne similar to yours and this helped me so much as well as taking Zinc and Vitamin A supplements. Zinc boosts your immune system and will help fight existing pimples and vitamin A helps with skin cell turnover. Also have Yogi Skin Detox Tea 2x a week.

Team overworked here.
While I do appreciate the fact that I’m still employed, it’s been hard working through the pandemic and shut downs.
It has affected the schedules of vendors and equipment technical representatives so we have to work around it. It has affected the speed of equipment and parts coming in, and we have to work around it...
We’re short on disinfectants. We’re short on staff because if their family members are showing symptoms, they have to stay home.
Grocery stores close by the time we’re off work. So we have to get our grocery shopping done in the morning before work. We also have to keep a weeks supply of food in our fridge because you never know when you get the call that you’ve been in close contact with someone who tested positive and you can’t leave the house.
I’m exhausted. I also have no sick leave. I don’t come to work, I don’t get paid.
It’s a physical job and I have to space out the hard physical stuff so I don’t stress my immune system too much. I’ve been drinking protein shakes and taking supplements to help my muscles heal after a long day.
Edit* to include tensions and frustrations. My co-workers and boss do not like that they cannot control this. So they subconsciously try to control everything else and micromanage. Interacting with them has been mentally draining.

It's one thing for companies to say, ""Pamper yourself by buying our shampoo!,"" and another for someone to imply that you need their products to ""boost your immunity"" and not get sick. And the timing also implies that you won't get sick from COVID-19. That's borderline medical advice and very irresponsible. Tati is totally trying to profit from the pandemic.

Okay, so there are hundreds of people on Twitter with covid symptoms in Japan. MOST of them feature very mild fever that comes in waves, and mild infrequent coughing. Some notable things in common are the condition lasts for weeks, and also chest pain. Also waves of breathing difficulty.
One woman was told by a doctor that it can't be corona because it doesn't last that long, but she was tested later and did have corona.
Some people on here are saying that the chance of having corona is so low because like only 500/40,000,000 (Tokyo) have it, but it's so obvious that the virus is far more widespread than that. Since February there have been thousands of people complaining of these light symptoms.
I honestly don't know why people don't want to believe there's a corona problem in Japan. Like, they don't want to believe it. Look at the stats, next week the case number in Tokyo will explode - it's the same pattern as Italy and New York just before it got bad with 50-100 new cases per day for 1-2 weeks prior to the boom.
So, all I'll say is, stay calm. Most corona cases are mild. There's of course a better than good chance you might have some other thing that's not corona.
HOWEVER.
Be careful with your breathing and chest pain. Corona tends to turn bad fast when it does turn bad, so figure out how to get to the hospital and what authorities want you to do in terms of getting there safely.
If you aren't self-isolating, do it. See, I know that it's impossible, with mild symptoms you'd never get excused from work (which all the ""don't test for corona"" people ignore for some reason). But if you can, seriously, self-isolate. The whole ""don't test"" policy hinges on people with mild cold symptoms self-isolating.
If you can't self isolate, don't feel guilty. This whole mess is Japan's fault, they could have chosen a different way of handling it. Still, wear a mask, don't touch surfaces, etc. etc. and you won't spread whatever you have as much. You can make a mask from cloth, or even wear a scarf over your mouth on the train at least. It will reduce how many droplets are leaving your mouth and hitting everyone else.
Vitamin C and D are good, as are fluids (don't forget electrolytes). Give your immune system the easy boost at least by taking these supplements.
Don't drink booze.
And,
Good luck

‘This is misinformation on steroids’: The Canadian who took on Gwyneth Paltrow is debunking coronavirus myths By Omar Mosleh Edmonton Bureau Mon., April 6, 2020
EDMONTON—A televangelist selling silver as a cure for COVID-19. The idea that drinking cow urine or bleach will help with symptoms. Or the suggestion that rubbing essential oils on a part of your body where the sun don’t shine will protect you.
As someone who has spent decades debunking myths and bad science, whether related to climate change, stem cells or vaccinations, Timothy Caulfield has almost heard it all.
But he says he’s never seen anything quite like this.
“This is misinformation on steroids,” said Caulfield, referring to the COVID-19 “infodemic” he’s hoping to fight.
The University of Alberta professor and health policy expert, host of “A User’s Guide to Cheating Death” on Netflix and author of “Is Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong about Everything?” is one of many researchers across the country who’s received funding from the federal government’s Rapid Research Funding Opportunity.
He and his team will be researching how COVID-19 misinformation spreads and how to stop it.
“With the coronavirus, what we’re seeing is those concerns I’ve been following for decades really amplified,” Caulfield said. “Even I’ve been astounded the degree to which misinformation in this context is spread and the impact it’s had.
“Here, it’s been ramped up very quickly, and on an international scale, and at the worst possible time.”
Caulfield noticed this is the first pandemic of its scale to take place in the era of social media, where information moves fast and furious. And often inaccurately.
And while governments and legacy media were once the gatekeepers of important information related to public health, it’s much harder to control how misinformation is spread on platforms like Facebook and Twitter, Caulfield said.
Misinformation can contribute to fear, confusion and anxiety in a pandemic. But it also has literal life or death consequences.
“There is actual death and physical harm when people listen to misinformation,” Caulfield said. “And we’ve seen that play out in the context of the coronavirus.”
One of the chemicals touted as possibly effective for COVID-19 is hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria medication. In March, an Arizona man died after consuming chloroquine phosphate, a fish tank cleaner, which he thought was hydroxychloroquine.
One of the interesting aspects of this infodemic that Caulfield has observed is the “continuum” of misinformation. Some ideas, like drinking bleach, would seem patently absurd to most people.
“But then you have this stuff that’s kind of in the middle, that seems more plausible or slightly more credible, like that you can boost your immune system (against COVID-19) or that you should be taking supplements,” Caulfield said.
On the positive side, there is evidence that people can typically tell when information is accurate if they simply take the time to pause and reflect — something Caulfield and his team hope they can help encourage more people to do.

I'm kind of confused, too. Don't get me wrong- I'm not the biggest Tati fan- but I feel like there was a large number of people just waiting for something to jump on her about. She never said it would actually prevent anything... she was suggesting ingredients she and her company have done research on. I'm not saying she is Mother Teresa, though... lol. She definitely has a habit of making herself look ""pure of heart"", and it's obvious she does stand to profit in some way from this. But I don't understand the anger a lot of people have. They were suggestions- take em or leave em! I don't know... if they were being marketed towards children or something, I would get it. But we are adults here. No one should ever take something and put it into their body without doing THEIR OWN research... she isn't twisting any arms, here... they are SUGGESTIONS.

Whenever I get too low on magnesium I start sleeping worse, stomach issues and irregular bowel movements and when it gets really bed I get restless legs which also makes it really hard to fall asleep.
I used to take Mg supplement every day but since I went on a strict autoimmune diet (because of breast feeding) I don’t need to supplement almost at all. When I notice these symptoms I take a pure powdered magnesiumsitrate by Puhdistamo (Finnish product).
What kind of symptoms do you have?
Ps: When I was very low on magnesium the powder didn’t taste anything in my opinion and now it’s has a strong taste that I dislike. It’s still the same box that I use. This phenomenon is likely to be linked to how our bodies signal about nutrient levels.

Same! It’s a bizarre feeling when I try to wear my “work clothes” - I’ve rearranged my apartment a few times in fits on anxiety to get a dedicated “office space” that I felt comfortable in, and the first day I worked at it I put jeans and a button down on thinking that would be the key to feeling “normal” - I felt like I was playing dress up or like you said, playing at work. I tried a few “productive morning routines” where I’d make a healthy breakfast, get some exercise in, read something positive, etc etc before starting each morning at the suggestion of a ton of WFH “best practices”, and that made me feel even worse. Finding a balance where I can be comfortable and still feel a bit put together has given me enough to have that “get ready” portion signal the start of my work day.

I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think you all might need to cut companies and their advertising some slack. Most businesses can't afford to just completely shut down for 2 weeks, a month, or however long this pandemic is going to last. They need to continue making sales or they won't be able to pay their employees, and there are many many companies and corporations out there who don't want to just fire everyone. So they keep advertising, keep trying to bring the money in. Most businesses are not sitting on giant reserves of cash to cover their expenses while they aren't making sales - this pandemic has made it clear that is a huge weak point in our current economy (at least in the US where I live). Just like so many Americans live paycheck to paycheck, so do companies in effect.
All that said I do think that advertising that claims to protect you against the virus is unethical and shouldn't be allowed.

Statistically, I seem to remember goldacre's bad science book saying that those who take vitamin c as a preventative supplement tend to be more likely to die, though it's not suggested to be causal.

The research she is speaking of is research done by the lab she uses, which is in fact, made of actual medical doctors. No vitamins are FDA approved, none. But that doesn't mean they can't be helpful or even required. Some people do have specific genetic issues or other medical issues, that would require taking vitamins. In fact, I am ordered, by my surgeon & primary, to take 2 Daily multivitamins a day, as well as 3 doses of calcium, due to my own medical issues. As well as additional B vitamins. But none of those are FDA approved. She's not being shady about what's in her vitamins, like a lot of companies. If you need or want them, cool. If you don't, continue on your way. The amount of people that take HSN vitamins, from various manufacturers, is enormous. And I, personally have taken hers, for several months at a time, on separate occasions, and can say, that there is a difference for me. Her telling people about different ingredients that may help immune function for some, is not shady. People still swear by fucking airborne and all that bs, and essential oils and weird fucking shit.

Hello to all going through this same trauma. I have no real point to this post except to vent.
My 51 year old brother was admitted to the hospital Wednesday with the usual Covid symptoms. He seemed OK when he was there and it looked as though he just needed a little help beating this thing. He did not have any pre existing conditions.
His 02 levels were OK at the beginning, then this morning they went down to 52 percent, The doctors were able to get it back up to 65, but then he coded (heart stopped). They intubated him and apparently got his heart started again briefly, but it did not last and he passed away.
This post really wont accomplish anything for me personally, but I will pass on a little bit of advice. If you are a Black person as I am, Please take some Vitamin D supplements. Its been proven to help the immune system fight against respiratory diseases. Black people DO NOT generate enough vitamin D in many cases. Its strictly due to the melanin in the skin, etc.
Encourage people to stay home, the social distancing needs to happen. I don't want any of you to feel the pain our family is going through now.
Don't wait to go to the hospital if you are sick, please. I think my brother waited too long to go in.
Love your families, Love your friends, and look out for each other.
Coming at you from NYC

As a conservative atheist, it's not that we think the virus is a hoax. We believe that the reaction to it is way too dramatic and takes away too many of our liberties as Americans. We are all mature adults and can make an effort to social distance ourselves without government mandates; everyone is aware of their own health conditions and people with compromised immune systems can make their own choices accordingly.
I believe that large gatherings, such as church sessions or sports games, should be the only things banned.
Instead of vaccines we should be looking towards boosting our immune systems with vitamin supplements and IV treatments. The rushed nature of the covid vaccine is also a cause for concern.

527,2020-04-03 02:47:00,Fighting misinformation about boosting of the immune system. I enjoy their podcast as well.,"
Wish we could get the watchers of the Joe Rogan Experience show to watch this. He has been heavily advocating strengthening the immune system in the this coronavirus pandemic, with exercise which is a good idea, but also with fad diets and supplements. Rogan is a great conversationalist and conducts excellent in-depth conversations with many interesting and often relevant people, but he's a fool for supplements and vitamins and shit like that, which he actually sells and profits from. I think he actually believes in quite a bit of woo like that, although fortunately not to the anti-vax level, so I don't think he sells the snake oil as a deliberate con. Rogan comes from an athletic background, and lots of athletes swear by superstitious stuff, and as Novella said on this video, doctors indeed do recommend supplements based on blood tests and professional evaluation of the specific patient's needs, so it's not a big jump to believe that if a top athlete or his coach used supplements during their training and then they won, they'd believe supplements helped just because of that.
It's fun, and informative, to watch his recent show with expert in infectious disease epidemiology Dr.Osterholm . Osterholm blows apart Rogan's hope that sitting in a sauna can prevent or kill the virus, and later dismisses Rogan's belief that supplements can help strengthen the immune system. Rogan's clearly upset that the doctor won't agree that supplements will do some good. Hilarious!

The RKI was heavily and openly criticized for their recommendations. And changed their recommendations based on these criticisms. Personally, I don't even think they were particularly reckless either, although misjudging some stuff - The rational behind their initial recommendation is understandable at least. hindsight is always a great perspective though. But I'm sure if you were in charge you would have handled everything differently.
Very generally speaking, Germany is handling the whole thing okayish in my opinion. The mortality rates are comparatively low and falling steadily, just as the rate of new infections. There is little consensus on what the ""right"" thing to do is at any given moment because there is little experience to rely on. Most decisions are more or less educated guesses anyway at this point.
But sure, if you want to be angry and enraged - you'll always find something. I've personally chosen to be extremely pissed about the G5 conspiracy theories linked to corona or people touting ""immune boosting supplements"" on Instagram or the racist shitheads insisting on calling it the ""Chinese Virus"" in that dreadful r/europe sub but each can choose their own hill to die on, there's loads to go around.

I’ve never seen him get this sick, even when he’s had mono and bronchitis. We just thought it was the flu that’s taking him forever to recover from the cough bc my mom and I received shots this year and he didn’t. If it’s the case, then 2/3 of my household had asymptomatic infections bc the man doesn’t know how to cover his mouth from coughing and would just cough all over the food at dinner for weeks. (“It’s just dry air, nothing bad is coming out”, dude did u even get a high school degree????).

For the most part, that is correct, however there are noted benefits to taking larger than the minimum necessary of a handful of vitamins and nutrients, with a few exceptions of course. I would strongly advise against taking Vitamin A and E unless deficient of either due to potential toxicities. On the other hand, due to Western diets and lack of sun exposure, most people tend to be at least moderately deficient of Vitamin D without even knowing it. Those I listed are GRAS with low or zero toxicity at normal doses, and potentially substantial added benefits when taken in supplement form, to one's immunity for example.

540,2020-04-01 09:59:00,How boosting my immune system helped clear chronic yeast infection,"
Hi everyone, for the past year I have suffered chronic yeast infection which never seemed to go away. Each month during around ovulation I would get curd-like discharge and my hooha would itch so bad.
I have tried many alternatives in treating my yeast infection which includes being prescribed fluconazole tablets, using gel pessaries, going on a candida cleanse diet, taking candida cleanse supplements, eating more garlic, and etc. All these methods seemed to just alleviate yeast infection symptoms but after my next cycle it just occurs again.
Recently due to the coronavirus, I have been taking more supplements just to get that extra boost for my immune system. I added all of the following supplements into my everyday consumption for the past two months: vitamin C and D3, Zinc, Selenium, Iodine, elderberry extract, spirulina powder, and manuka honey.
After taking the mentioned supplements religiously everyday my yeast infection did not reoccur this month. I had no curd-like discharge and it did not itch! I was so happy because I always felt extremely terrible whenever my period ends and ovulation is approaching, knowing that I would have to go through the curd-like discharge again. Wearing pantyliners all the time is just a terrible experience.
All of the supplements I took had immunity boosting qualities, which I assume helped my body fight back against the candida in my body. Using the immune system to heal is supposed to be the most natural and effective method anyways.
I just wanted to share my experience for you ladies out there who have chronic yeast infection and are finding alternatives from prescription medicine. Please do consider taking supplements that boost your immune system. Another plus from taking the supplements would also be protecting yourself from coronavirus as well!

If not that worked extremely well on my redness. If you can’t use that I would suggest First Aid Beauty Arnica Relief & Rescue or First Aid Beauty Oat & Hemp Seed Dry Oil.
Also is your skin sensitive to tretinoin or clindamycin? I have sensitive combo acne prone skin and Curology worked well for me and based off your picture may work well for you too. Also keep in mind acne on your cheeks like that could be from the bacteria and oils on your phone from talking and pillowcase from side sleeping. If you can help it try to sleep on your way back as much as possible to keep your skin off your pillow case and Clorox wipe you’re phone every week to clean.
Also I would suggest, taking zinc and vitamin A supplements. Zinc helps your immune system and fights acne while vitamin A helps with new skin cell renewal, also collagen peptide powder helps reduce pore size! Hope this helps.

So why is India recording so few cases compared to Italy?
Is it because they have darker skin and lower vitamin D levels or is it because of some other factor unrelated to vitamin D?
I don't see how you can just say that India are very brown/low vitamin D and don't have many cases therefore vitamin D does not have a protective effect. This doesn't account for a variety of other factors that could be at play.
We do know that in New York, an ethnically mixed area, that black and minority (i.e. non white skin) people are being dis-proportionally affected by the virus which lends itself to the theory that vitamin D is having a protective effect in the white population.
We already know that vitamin D has a protective effect when it comes to respiratory infections so I don't know why your so hellbent on discouraging vitamin D supplementation.
Low vitamin D levels will obviously weaken the immune system. It's common sense, its old science.

If it was real research she would have credible doctors and experts backing her claims. She does not have that.
You are prescribed specific vitamins by your doctor because you have a risk for deficiency due to your medical issues. No doctor will ever prescribe to someone to take a vitamin if they do not have a deficiency or a risk of deficiency. Most people do not have a deficiency, and Tati markets that people without deficiencies should take them. That is false information and why you should be skeptical of taking them from her.

Don’t drag me but I actually appreciate the sale alerts for WFH clothes, home office furniture, etc. I’m aware of how privileged I am to be able to maintain my job and work remotely throughout this - my employer has been somewhat ahead of this compared to others in my state and has been remote for nearly six weeks now. I’m also incredibly fortunate to be on antidepressants and anti anxiety medication to help me cope. That being said, a cute pair of sweats I’m not embarrassed to be in if my boss calls makes me feel less shameful about how much I’ve been eating, how little I’ve been working out, and how for the first time in my entire career I’m not putting makeup on every single day. I’ve been unreasonably worried about how “disheveled” I appear at times, but working from home all day in business casual (or even jeans and a tee shirt) make me feel even more disconnected ... almost like a flagrant attempt to pretend like everything is business as usual (speaking for myself, of course). Having loungewear I can be comfortable in but still have that separation between pjs/“work” leggings or sweats has helped me a bit, and as more of my clients transition to virtual environments I’ve noticed more and more people I’ve previously only ever seen in incredibly poised and professional environments and in suits video call me in sweats with kids and animals running around in the background. There was a great article I saw the other day with Emily Post’s granddaughter (IIRC) about zoom in etiquette under “normal” circumstances and zoom etiquette now, and how relaxed or irrelevant some of the previous “rules” should become when we are working through a global pandemic.
All of that said: I am privileged AF to even worry about zoom etiquette or if my sweatshirt is virtual work appropriate, and I’m privileged to feel guilty about the fact I just had pizza for breakfast. I appreciate that I’ve been able to indulge myself right now with “WFH essentials”. Most emails I’ve gotten about those sales have been less wellness centric and more straight up: “Take x% off our coziest WFH collection” or something, and then in either separate communications or distinctly separate parts of the email: “here is what we are doing in response to COVID-19”. They are clearly capitalizing on it, but I appreciate that someone was aware providing consumers with cute sweats and a new desk isn’t a generous and compassionate response to COVID-19, and it certainly isn’t boosting anyone’s immune system.

Ummm, anything in large amounts will cause harm to the body. Literally everything is toxic if the dosage is too high, even water. The prescriptions doctors give is designed to be a non-toxic dosage (many doctors lean on overprescribing to an extent, but not to a toxic degree). The dosage is always tested beforehand by the CDC.
Also, taking excess vitamin C and D does not make your immune system stronger, neither do zinc supplements. You just end up pissing out the excess without it being processed by your body. If you have a normal diet (EAT YOUR VEGETABLES), exercise regularly, get plenty of sleep, and don't do obviously unhealthy things (drinking, taking drugs, etc...), then your immune system is likely working at maximum capacity (exceptions go to those who are immuno-compromised, but eating vitamin C and D, or zinc won't help you).
To give a metaphor, if you want a construction project to be done sooner, you can't just deliver more materials and expect it to be done sooner. Most people get enough vitamin C and D just from eating a normal or semi-normal diet, eating more of it isn't going to make anything better.
Also, making your immune system stronger doesn't prevent you from getting the virus, it just makes the response time and recovery time faster, but that's nitpicking. I like nitpicking.

I think the difference is that as opposed to something obviously unrelated to a pandemic (like makeup or clothing) where the ads are more marketed towards ‘treating yourself,’ marketing your products to people with the implication that it will keep them from getting sick during a pandemic is predatory. It is manipulative because she isn’t just a company, she’s a person and that’s part of her branding. She markets herself to her audience and a lot of scared, impressionable people will likely be wasting their money on overpriced vitamins. Hearing someone you look up to recommending their specific vitamins to ‘protect yourself’ carries a lot more weight than an email from CVS. Both are wrong, but her history of pseudoscience makes this worse IMO.

598,2020-04-05 07:28:00,If a pregnant woman is given a vaccine does the unborn child also gain immunity?,"
Yes but only temporarily; It’s called passive immunity , because the baby’s immune system does not take an active role in defence by creating its own antibodies. That’s because the vaccine itself does not pass to the baby (which would cause its immune system to make antibodies), but rather antibodies created by the mother are passed to the baby.
The antibodies are passed via the placenta in the third trimester. Premature babies are therefore much more at risk from disease upon birth.
It’s also important to note that this isn’t restricted to vaccines given while pregnant. For instance if the mother has ever had chickenpox, the baby will be immune for a short while at birth. Measles, mumps and rubella antibodies can last up to a year in the baby’s system, which is why the MMR vaccine is not given until later (and a reason for grouping these particular vaccinations together into one shot).
Antibodies are also passed through breast milk, and the thicker, yellowish milk that the mother creates during the first few weeks after birth is particularly high in antibodies. So breast-fed babies have passive immunity for longer, and are able to receive new antibodies that the mother creates after birth. The really cool thing is that through breast feeding, the mother can detect viruses present in the baby’s saliva (such as coronaviruses), and supplement the baby’s own immune response by creating antibodies which are then passed to the baby through milk, even though the mother never had the disease herself.
The timing of immunisations for babies is based on how this passive immunity wears off. If given too early, passive immunity can defeat the disease without the baby’s immune system having to respond very much, and the baby doesn’t actually develop immunity. If given too late there will be a period during which the baby is completely unprotected. The timing is not an exact science but “booster” shots help to ensure that the baby’s own immune system has to enough work to build long-lasting immunity.
I mentioned above that MMR isn’t given until the baby is a year old. That’s because passive immunity lasts about a year. The 6-in-1 vaccination is given much earlier, and in multiple doses. It’s given earlier because passive immunity to the diseases it protects against wears off in a couple of months.
Whilst in the womb, the baby is also safe from many diseases because the viruses that cause them are not blood-borne and so cannot pass from mother to baby. Coronaviruses for example affect the respiratory system (and possibly the digestive system); thus the baby is safe from infection while in the womb, but but could receive antibodies via the placenta before birth, to give some protection upon birth.
Anti-vaxxers may therefore be saving up another nasty issue: Most of them were actually vaccinated against some pretty terrible diseases; But if herd immunity is enough that their kids don’t catch them, then eventually their grandchildren will be born with no immunity at all, and with the declining herd immunity they have also caused, the fatality rate in newborn babies could sky rocket.

Thread 🧵 ⬇️
1) What they do?
They can work by killing senescent cells
2) How so?
By Inhibiting the proinflammatory secretory phenotype of senescent cells (senomorphics) or by activating our endogenous senolytic systems (immune surveillance).
3) But what even are senescent cells?
Senescent cells are cells which have suffered from -
-Stress
-DNA Damage
-Oncogene Activation
-Oxidative Stress
4) Whats the problem with this?
It leads to permanent cell cycle arrest. Stop dividing and
It leads to toxic secretions 5) Better stop that, right?
Actually it could be both Good & Bad .
Senescent cells can be -
Good - Suppresses tumour (Via Cell Cycle Arrest)
Bad - Tomour Development and Inflammation (Via Toxic Secretion)
huh?
Senotheraputics is the answer if you fall into the Bad category.
6) There are 3 types of Senotheraputics in the works -
Senolytics - Drugs & Compounds which selectively kill senescent cells.
Senomorphics - Compounds to Reduce the toxins secreted by senescent cells.
Immune Surveillance - Using the immune system to target senescent cells.
7) Supplements currently being studied for Senolytics -
- Quercetin
- Fisetin
Reportedly works well when combined with the drug Dasatinib
8) Senomorphics on the other hand
Works by inhibiting MTOR & NF-kB protiens.
Drugs being researched to achieve this are
1.Metformin
2.Rapamycin
9) Problem with Senotheraputics?
Its currently difficult to identify if senescent cells have been removed from the body.

""Vitamin D metabolizing enzymes and vitamin D receptors are present in many cell types including various immune cells such as antigen-presenting-cells, T cells, B cells and monocytes. In vitro data show that, in addition to modulating innate immune cells, vitamin D also promotes a more tolerogenic immunological status. In vivo data from animals and from human vitamin D supplementation studies have shown beneficial effects of vitamin D on immune function, in particular in the context of autoimmunity. In this review, currently available data are summarized to give an overview of the effects of vitamin D on the immune system in general and on the regulation of inflammatory responses, as well as regulatory mechanisms connected to autoimmune diseases particularly in type 1 diabetes mellitus.""

It's disgusting and so hard to handle. I've been shocked by what the pandemic has brought out in people and trying to figure it out and cope with the disillusionment and disgust for over a year.
Here are some of my thoughts on these people (not that understanding them excuses their behavior or really helps much, but it may be helpful if you see them as just seeking control and full of fear, even if they won't admit it). In addition to all the conspiracy theories, misinformation, bad science, politicization, etc., surrounding the pandemic, I think people are just trying to cope in really unhealthy ways. They're trying to convince themselves there's nothing to fear, by finding ""evidence"" that they'll be fine, that this couldn't happen to them, etc. It's like when someone dies of a heart attack and others say it's because the person was overweight and ate poorly so since they themselves exercise, are a healthy weight, and eat well, it couldn't happen to them. Never mind that sometimes healthy athletes drop dead of heart attacks. I think it's all connected to people needing to feel a sense of control. So you see the ones talking about boosting their immune systems, taking supplements (vitamin D and so on), following certain diets, exercising.
There's also an underlying sense of (moral?) superiority in society related to health, which to me sounds a bit like eugenics. Just look at what some people say about weight issues. They lack understanding and nuance about health or any ability to see past their own experiences. It's...disappointing, to say the least.
I hope you can find some peace as you recover and grieve, and that you are able to find some people with intelligence, wisdom, empathy, and compassion to surround yourself with."

vitamin C certainly does have the kidney stone risk. Maybe it has something to do with high protein diets increasing stone risk in addition to vitamin C? regardless, on 200g-210g protein per day, 1000mg or 1500mg vitamin C was easily tolerable. Bump it up to 2000mg for a few days, and suddenly painful urination starts occurring, kidney pain/urinary pain/bladder pain starts. Bump it up to 3000mg for a few days and symptoms are massively worse.
I'm also curious of vitamin C's effects on autoimmune disease? autoimmune disease is an overactive overstimulated immune system, so I wonder if something like vitamin C would exacerbate, potentially even promote autoimmune disease? synthetic vitamin C supplementation is much different than vitamin C containing foods considering vitamin C foods you can eat as much as you want with minimal kidney stone risk

Every one keeps talking about vitamin d but it’s useless if you’re not taking consuming any calcium in their diet. Further more, that simply raises blood calcium levels, and not necessarily meaning it replenishes the parts of our body where the high concentration and supply used is: bones and teeth. Vitamin k2 mk7 is a vitamin that shuttles calcium back into bones and helps repair the dentine layer under the enamel. When Blood calcium is low, endocrine system detects it, sends the parathyroid hormone to tell body to leech calcium stores from bones and teeth, contributing long term to osteoporosis

I’ve been watching MedCram videos for a while now since this coronavirus started. (My providers at the offices recommended this channel to stay informed) Roger Seheult a Internal med/ pulmonologist and ICU doctor talks about research and studies that have shown to improve patients health when a respiratory illness strikes (SARS-COVID 2).
Here is the link to the most recent video which is a summary of his daily routine and supplements he takes to boost your immune system and minimize risk of COVID 19.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=NM2A2xNLWR4
In summary here is what he recommends:
Zinc 50mg every other day
Quercertin 500mg every day
Vitamin D 2000 IU a day (50 mg)
Vitamin C 100-150 mg a day
Good night sleep
He also recommends bathing in hot and then cold water. (Hydrotherapy)
Example:
5 min. From hot water to where you can | 1 min of cold water to where you can | 3 min of hot water | 1 min of cold water | 3 min of hot water | 1 min of cold water |
All this has been backed up by clinical research and data presented on his previous videos.
I recommend people to watch his videos and pass this information on. Maybe it will help someone out there that really needs it.
Stay safe!

Greetings, I just want to share a positive note to restate that the purpose of self-isolation and staying at home is an effective strategy to break the chain of transmission. We often hear that upon doing so we help to ""flatten the curve"" so-to-speak. Be confident that if you and your family have been practicing ""social distancing"" as much as possible, then you will be reducing the likelihood of exposure. The positive is that your physical home is an isolating home.
I am counted as being in the moderate to high risk group due to the fact that I have a low grade cancer and am being monitored regularly. I am trying plant-based supplements to support and strengthen my immune system. Personally, I have had a positive response to these supplements. Not everyone believes in supplements, so just know that it is an individual choice to do so.
Positive adaptive mindfulness is important as well. This is to offer that we are being challenged to adjust and understand our lives within the current pandemic we are in. Living in fear is difficult. We lose a great deal of energy through worry, loss of sleep, and in our attempts to constantly maintain our personal protection. Be in balance with your energy and mindfulness as much as you are able, adjust as necessary, and take a break from the constant worry if you feel overwhelmed. Most of all know that you are not alone. Reaching out is always good.

Meals: Tofu + veggie stir fry: bell peppers, onions, broccoli, carrots, baby canned corn, etc. whatever you end up buying! Mix peanut butter, soy sauce, garlic powder, sriracha, pepper, and red pepper flakes for a fantastic peanut sauce!
Tacos: Black beans, rice, chopped lettuce, either canned or fresh made salsa, chopped up avocado, fajita veggies (bell peppers and onions), and if you’re feeling fancy bbq jackfruit or tofu scramble (you can find recipes for these online!)
Pasta: literally just pasta and sauce haha. I really love using lentil pasta, so much protein in a serving. Another way to mix this up and add more veggies is to make a veggie lasagna with zucchini, carrots, onions, and broccoli. I chop up and pan fry everything but the zuchini with spices before adding it to my layers.
Peanut sauce pad thai: the one is a fantastic quarantine meal as it only needs frozen and shelf safe ingredients! Same peanut sauce as listed above, cook some rice noodles and throw frozen veggies on the noodles as they boil in a pot (my fave is frozen broccoli, peas, and carrots). Then drain and add sauce!
Chili: garlic, onions, bell pepper (fry in a pot with oil), add rinsed can of black beans and kidney beans, add big can of crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce, add spices (black pepper, salt, hot sauce, paprika, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, chili powder, etc!) simmer to your liking! Can also serve this with rice or eat with tortilla chips.
Oatmeal: you can use an instant pack of oatmeal of dried steel cut oats, add some peanut butter, ground flax seeds, and frozen berries on top. So good.
Our cabinet stock + some freezer stock: Rice
Canned beans (black, pinto)
Canned chickpeas
Dried lentils
Pasta sauce

5lbs bag of carrots
Bananas
Lemons/limes
Sometimes avocados
Tofu and tempeh
Oat milk
Anything else we’re running low on in our cabinet!
I take a b12 spray once a day, and I would suggest this for ANYONE not just vegans. A lot of people are deficient in this. B12 comes from bacteria in the soil and is lost in modern day vegetable cultivation from cleaning. Farmed animals are given B12 shots. So instead of eating a whole animal or 2,000lbs of mushrooms full of dirt, I just take a vitamin haha. I also take a 5,000IU vitamin d3 supplement for my immune system. Protein is not a problem on a vegan diet as long as you are eating enough calories. Would recommend a good source of omega-3! Ground flax seeds and hemp seeds are good sources. You can also find a vegan vitamin. You can use the app chronometer if you want to see how you are doing nutritionally throughout the day! Good luck, stay safe, and happy eating! :)

Didn't do that much. I bought 5 sets of supplements that were supposed to help with lung function and immune function reaction if you have covid19: resveratrol, NAC, Quercetin and Vitamin D. I live in Canada, and I sent them to a friend in Canada, two family members in the US, and two other friends in Canada. Total cost, about 130 each, I think.
I have a friend in the UK (online friend only) who historically comes down with bad respiratory diseases, so I sent him money (~200 CAD) to get a bacterial pneumonia shot, since I was concerned about him, if he ever got Covid.
But I haven't done anything else in the last month or two. These were early on, when things were just starting to get serious. I did ring the warning bell on my facebook and regularly kept updating my circle of friends and co-workers on possible steps they should take (ie: buy toilet paper before the crunch).

It’s better to get all the nutrients you need in from the food you eat and not supplements. Your body has natural appetite suppression but it takes 1 to 2 days to occur, depending on how fast you go into ketosis. You will not feel hungry at all, your body has two modes, building and repairing. The standard American diet promotes constant building with no time to kill useless cells to be repurposed, such as immune cells... during these times. Scientifically proven that if you fast for 3 days and then refeed on a nutritious real food meal, that comes from the ground, plant, tree, animal. Basically anything at the outside parts of grocery stores, you will strengthen your immune system. Machine learning is based off this concept, the strongest cells get replicated while the weak generations die off. Alike to your immune system, supplements are not always bad, for example a polio vaccine. But alike to right now herd immunity is people taking care of their health and body and letting it fight the virus naturally and create a new generation of antibodies which can be used to fight easier the next time you get it or not even contract it at all. The more you depend on external factors like multiple drugs doing the bodies natural processes, the higher risk these viruses become immune to those medications and even vaccines. Take care of your nutrition and give your body time to heal and only eat what you need to satiate it. Calories are like a bun and they consist of filling proteins fats and carbohydrates, most carb products are empty of nutrients so you are giving your body a nutrient void sandwich each time, it’s like putting gold fish pasta rice between 2 buns, while if you put veggies meats on your sandwich you will have tons of vitamins and protein that your body needs. If you love food like I do, dive deep into good foods, look at pesto a good garlic onion mushroom butter basted steak with steamed or stir fried veggies. You can make way better foods at home cooking and that will satiate your body, this is the real way to be a foodie instead of munching on a bag of chips or Oreos, even if they are fucking amazing at times. Before fasting, Look into a healthy relationship with food each day and not eat few hours before bed and eat at noon and that will do you wonders. That is what I’m doing and I’m from a big guy to beach body apart from a little belly fat. I still love to eat as I did before but it’s managed better through different mindful choices in the kitchen. You can still eat what you love and make new things and that’s the most amazing part. Also listen to your body when it tells you something, feel crappy and sluggish and couldn’t do what you could a few years ago, you can get back your youth and ability if you just listen. Learn what is thirst, because it’s very similar to hunger and also notice any inflammation or acne or pains. Your body tells you things and gives you cravings and you can find alternatives. It’s a conveyor belt that goes to a adapting living machine that can improve or start to fail and it will give you error messages and beep codes when it doesn’t like something on the conveyor belt, you can choose to ignore it or you can try and listen and get that baby purrin like a finely tuned hemi engine. It’s just small actions, right fuel and engine oil, maintenance and cleaning and you have a beautiful car, if you ignore squeaky breaks, ac belt isn’t working. Oil low and putting leaded fuel in an unleaded car. Why do you think salesmen always have pearly white teeth, their words are their life and they want to have it clean as it’s a representation of their brand.

I actually often disagree with Joe, to an extent that I'm wondering why I even listen to the podcast.
But I do agree with him on the point that we should focus on raising the overall health and immunity of people through education and supplements, protect the weaker members of society and just go back to work and let this burn itself out.
I know people don't like this opinion and it's sad that the downvote brigade can't accept other opinions or treat them with arguments instead of hiding them.
I'm not saying masks are bad, I'm just saying that we need to focus on protecting a very small minority of society and educating the rest so that they take their health into their own hands. I strongly believe in the vitamin D argument for one.
Of course in a country like the US, this proposed strategy would be devastating because there are so many poorly educated in poor health.
My perspective is from Sweden and here we eat a lot of fish to survive the winter depression, or pop a lot of vitamin D pills to get the same effect. That's why most Swedish cultural food is fishy, because of the high vitamin D content.
I started reminding all my relatives and friends to take their Vitamin D more than two months ago. Because of this meta study I saw with over 10k participants, showing clearly that vitamin D raises immunity against respiratory infection.
And I grew up with somalian friends who had weird cravings for canned fish every winter, until they started taking vitamin D supplements. So I know that dark skinned people are vulnerable.
None of this is new to me, or anyone here in Sweden.

Look at who this was tested on. Young, healthy people who are not at risk from the virus. For SARS it was reported in animal studies that vaccines made young healthy animals immune. However, not only did the vaccine fail to yield immunity in aged animals, it made the animals sick when later exposed to a similar virus. So these short term safety tests in young healthy volunteers can not be generalized to old or comorbid people in the general population who will later be challenged by the next SARS to come out (which seems to happen every 5-10 years).
To evaluate the efficacy of existing vaccines against infection with SHC014-MA15, we vaccinated aged mice with double-inactivated whole SARS-CoV (DIV). Previous work showed that DIV could neutralize and protect young mice from challenge with a homologous virus14; however, the vaccine failed to protect aged animals in which augmented immune pathology was also observed, indicating the possibility of the animals being harmed because of the vaccination15. Here we found that DIV did not provide protection from challenge with SHC014-MA15 with regards to weight loss or viral titer (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). Consistent with a previous report with other heterologous group 2b CoVs15, serum from DIV-vaccinated, aged mice also failed to neutralize SHC014-MA15 (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Notably, DIV vaccination resulted in robust immune pathology (Supplementary Table 4) and eosinophilia (Supplementary Fig. 5d–f). Together, these results confirm that the DIV vaccine would not be protective against infection with SHC014 and could possibly augment disease in the aged vaccinated group. https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985

Until today there is study to prove Vitamin D substitution has any effect on the overall well-being of a human individual except for bone health.
There have been hundreds of studies trying to prove the suspected positive effects of Vitamin D. All of them failed to either show enough evidence to establish cause and effect relations or link Vitamin D intake to health benefits.
While there might be correlations and the ""feeling"" that there seems to be a connection, no scientific study supports this.
Scientifically proven effect: - positive effects on bone density and reduction of bone fractures risk.
Not scientifically proven or refuted: - positive effects on any other health related benefits.
Edit 1: Relating to the topic of osteoporosis and Vitamin D Inadequacy:
Almost every person living person north of latitude 45° has a periodic Vitamin D Inadequacy. This regularly leads to low bone density and therefore elevates the risk of bone fractures. Therefore it is recommended for people older 60 years to examine their bone density (in Europe the standard is a DXA test on hip and lower spine) and suggested to take a protective dose of 1000 I.U. Vitamin D (with fatty meals). If bone density is to low the dose has to be adjusted and additional medication prescribed. !!! It is not recommended for an adult to intake more than 4000 I.U. of Vitamin D. Doses for kids are significantly lower. !!!

Take a high quality zinc supplement because that will help your immune system, but ask your doctor about it though. If you aren’t allergic, you should use zinc lozenges before and afterwards just to give you some extra protection because it was shown that zinc helps. This virus tricks cells in your body by disguising itself as a protein and there are pharmaceutical drugs out there that were not approved, but showing promise that used protease (protein) inhibitors and I just looked up to see if there were any foods that had protease inhibitors and a few foods that popped up were soy beans, lima beans, egg whites, and peanuts. The downside of protease inhibitors is that they tend to not be good for your digestive system or your pancreas because the pancreas deals with proteins.
Natural trypsin Inhibitors also known as serine protease inhibitors (serpins) are the largest and most diverse family of protease inhibitors.1 Serpins control the activation and catabolism of proteins by the inhibition of serine proteases in vivo.2 There are four natural sources of trypsin inhibitors: bovine pancreas, ovomucoid, soybean, and lima bean. Each inhibitor acts as a competitive substrate analog and binds with its serine protease to form an inactive complex, therefore rendering the protease inactive.3 This process allows the serpin (trypsin inhibitor) to stop the proteolytic activity of the serine protease when its function is no longer necessary. Trypsin inhibitors provide unique processes depending on their source. For example, inhibitors in the seeds of legumes (soybean and lima bean) act as a feeding deterrent for insects by disrupting midgut proteases. This natural function is being expanded upon in the development of insect resistant transgenic plants. Soybean inhibitors have also been found to contribute to pancreatic hypertrophy in rats, again providing a feeding deterrent. The Bowman-Birk soybean inhibitor is being studied as a cancer preventive agent.
https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/biology/trypsin-inhibitors.html
So, check with your doctor, but maybe adding one or a small amount of each of lima beans, soybeans (or even soy milk), or egg whites into your deadly regimen might not be a bad thing. Food is powerful, but I wouldn’t just eat a lot of it as it can overtax your pancreas. I honestly wish more studies would be done on these foods and COVID19.
You should also ask your dentist if it would be safe to do oil pulling with coconut oil as coconut oil is antiviral, antimicrobial, and antibacterial after your surgery.

I personally take a cal/mag/zinc supplement just once daily to mainly to hit my mag and zinc requirements. I like it because it’s simple, It wasn’t a formulated product by the fitness industry. ZMA however is promoted as dot dot dot. If you catch my drift, but everyone’s got their own cup of tea. If you’re already taking ZMA don’t take another zinc supplement on top.

I thought the same. He does have a lot of good points across the board, and yes there is something to be said about how very few people take an active approach in strengthening their immune systems via diet, exercise, and de-stessing. The exessive use of sanitizers and antibiotics is creating superbugs while failing to build an immune system capable of handling a wider variety of bugs, plus lack of exposure to certain histamines is creating food allergies where normally there might not be (i.e. early exposure to peanuts seems to help prevent peanut allergies). And yes, exposure and then overcoming viruses in many cases does result in immunity that the system uses to fight off subsequent infections of the same or similar viruses.
THAT SAID
He is way too optimistic about how the immune system functions. It's not really capable of handling most parasites that can get past our stomach acid. I'm surprised he's never heard of brain eating amoeba that don't care about your immune system. Throwing a bunch of bugs at your immune system doesn't necessarily mean you're giving it a protein shake. Certain bugs result in poor antibodies or short lived antibodies, a process which is also linked to your specific biology.
Holy crap his misunderstanding of the flu vaccine is nuts. Yes we don't have an all-strain vaccine, but we're actually pretty good at predicting which strain is going to be the major one for the year, and as they say on the podcast being close is good enough that it offers some protection. Ultimately if your immune to the major strain and come in contact with it you won't spread it the same way someone who didn't get the flu shot would (herd immunity).
Ultimately, operating your immune system is very taxing on the body and the immune system itself can become overburdened by one virus allowing another to get on by. In this respect, supplements might help provide the building blocks for new immune cells, but your body has a hard limit on how quickly it can replace them that is independent of what you're eating.
TL;DR He does have some good points about exposure to pathogens being a good thing, to a point. The immune system has many many limitations, especially genetic ones that are independent of exposure or diet that he's not taking into account.

Tongue kiss someone with Covid19 for a while or lick toilet seats or otherwise expose yourself to a large viral load and the virus can infect a lot more cells before your defenses can react.
This means that either your immune system is badly outnumbered, or it goes into emergency mode and maybe kills you by overreacting (ketosis).
Covid19 can go about 15 feet through the air, but stay 6 feet away, wear masks, and don't go out much and even if you are exposed you will likely get such a small dose your immune system will kill it without you even noticing.
Oh, and get some sun/take vitamin D supplements. There is good evidence that D helps regulate your immune system so it protects you better and is less likely to go nuts and kill you.

Hello everyone,
I'm a Male in his 40s, generaly healthy except for GERD and Hiatal Hernia which I treat daily with Omeprazole. Two months ago I started to take the supplements listed below to boost my immune system. I didn't have any blood tests to messure my levels, just followed the advice of a friend:
Vitamin C 1000 mg Vitamin D3 5000 iu Zinc 25 mg L-LYSINE 500 mg Magnesium 500 mg
In the past couple of weeks I'm having occasional pimple breakouts on my face as well as patches of Seborrheic dermatitis which I didn't experience for years. They aren't severe but worrisome. I'm trying to avoid visiting my doctor because I'm living with a partner in quarantine. She is an immunocompromised patient.
Do any of the supplements I'm taking, as well as dosage, known to agrivate skin conditions? From my research these perticular ones should, if anything, improve the skin.

""The immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D offer opportunities to improve the treatment of several autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis. ""

"". These novel 1,25(OH)2D functions have encouraged investigators to develop vitamin D as a potential therapy for MS. ""
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32373353
""Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in all ages regardless of climate or geographical location and evidence is emerging that the incidence of autoimmune diseases is increasing worldwide. Women make up a large proportion of autoimmune disease diagnoses, underscoring the importance of fully elucidating the complex synergistic relationships between estrogens and vitamin D. Vitamin D receptor-activating drugs appear to enhance remyelination in patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating diseases such as neuromyelitis optica (NMO). ""
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3098920/

I’ve been watching MedCram videos for a while now since this coronavirus started. (My providers at the offices recommended this channel to stay informed) Roger Seheult a Internal med/ pulmonologist and ICU doctor talks about research and studies that have shown to improve patients health when a respiratory illness strikes (SARS-COVID 2).
Here is the link to the most recent video which is a summary of his daily routine and supplements he takes to boost your immune system and minimize risk of COVID 19.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=NM2A2xNLWR4
In summary here is what he recommends:
Zinc 50mg every other day
Quercertin 500mg every day
Vitamin D 2000 IU a day (50 mg)
Vitamin C 100-150 mg a day
Good night sleep
He also recommends bathing in hot and then cold water. (Hydrotherapy)
Example:
5 min. From hot water to where you can | 1 min of cold water to where you can | 3 min of hot water | 1 min of cold water | 3 min of hot water | 1 min of cold water |
All this has been backed up by clinical research and data presented on his previous videos.
I recommend people to watch his videos and pass this information on. Maybe it will help someone out there that really needs it.
Stay safe!

Incorrect. In autoimmune diseases, for example, the D vitamin levels are also low, but supplementing with vitamin D actually causes the autoimmune symptoms to get WORSE after some time:

The low level of D during COVID may be the body's reaction to better deal with the infection. It's a hypothesis, but one that needs to be checked before you can go and tell everyone to eat pills.

Eat immune boosting foods, get as much vitamin d from sunlight as you can (or even take a supplement), exercise, hydrate, and rest. You want your immune system to be as strong as you can get it.

Igg will remain, hence the past infection they're talking about, if they saw igg but not igm. Ebv can lead to auto immune type conditions...

Magnesium is better for sleep as it stimulates GABA receptors which are responsible for calming the central nervous system. If you drink a lot of coffee and fizzy drinks, they can block magnesium absorption, so it’s worth taking a magnesium supplement to top up.
Unless you eat a lot of vegetables, most people don’t get enough magnesium anyway. It’s also important to stop the “calcification” of the body.
Magnesium also stimulates growth hormone in the body. It’s one of the most underrated minerals and supplements you can buy.
Zinc is good for your immune system and testosterone production. Zinc supplementation is not really needed though if you eat meat, eggs and nuts regularly. Too much zinc can block other minerals such as iron. I wouldn’t take more than 15mg a day. A lot of supps give as much as 50mg. That much is not needed long term.
Curcumin is excellent for overall health, warding off diseases such as cancer and diabetes.
A Mushroom complex supplement too are great for the immune system but also energy and focus. They are considered a superfood and adaptogen - herbs that help fight stress.
I went through a bad period a few years ago suffering with anxiety, panic attacks and insomnia. I think it was brought on from taking a cocktail of supplements to fight hair loss such as saw palmetto, nettle root and pumpkin seeds.

Think logistically most scenarios would lead to the same shortages and outage of public services.
In the beginning, think it depends on your location and how much time you spend on public transport. If you're in a remote location then keep yourselves to yourselves as far as possible, keep contact with the outside to a minimum. Take supplements to boost your immune system (to many to list, everyone has their own preferences).
Ive always got a couple of minimalist carbon filter masks and alcohol gel in my bag just in case. Though I'd keep an eye out for the news (multiple sources and medical professionals I know) to decide when it goes from ""tin hat"" to ""damn smart"" to wear a mask in public. I've also got a heavy duty respirator mask but that's only for when it gets really dire. Though I'd avoid public transport as much as possible if it comes to it.

797,2020-01-12 13:06:00,"Back after nearly a year, doing well","
Thought id give everyone a quick update about my disappearance since about a year ago.
Lots has happened in my life: found a partner for life, beaten (so far) testicular cancer and in roughly 6 months from now Im becoming a father.
Long story short im doing fine at the moment and it was the most hectic year of my life so far with ups and downs.
Though I feel as if im doing far better than before (I feel absolutely blessed with my partner), I still feel as if there is more to gain mood/emotionally wise and since Ive been delaying making a post here over the last few months I thought Id just do it.
Hopefully I can continue to gain insight in what our problem is and why (paradoxically) something toxic and bad such as a hangover and in some/most also a fever and sleep deprivation induces such a powerful adaptation response that brings our suboptimal brain function back to normal.
One striking aspect of it is that the hangover seems to temporarily fix a wide range of mental and physical disorders/problems for people on here, which makes it pretty obviously that the that alcohol induces a huge variety of adapation.
Immune activation/modulation through LPS stimulation and subsequently il-6 and il-17a activation/modulation triggers a host of adapations.
Il-6 for example is needed for normal VTA dopamine function and il-17a can (paradoxically) normalize behavior in ASD.
Interleukins also have a powerful effect on NMDAR transmission
​
Then theres the jolt of the cortisol elevation which is considered pro-depressive to 'normal people'. Yet generally speaking alcohol, sleep deprivation aswell as fever increase cortisol.
On top of that theres an increase of glutamate (receptor) activity in the amygdala during a hangover as a compensatory mechanism due to alcohol inhibiting AMPA and NMDA in the 'drunk phase'.
​
There seems to be the general consensus that stress is bad (yes it is in excess amounts). However cortisol is considered more of an adaptation/coping hormone rather than being purely a negative one.
​
So far I have had most relieve from drugs/supplements that alter immune response, such as SAM-E, raising adenosine, caffeine anhydrous (better than coffee or energydrinks imo), Psilocybin (mainly while on it and the days after), piracetam, vitamin c and sigma-1 agonists.
​
Edit: added caffeine, works better for me (reward wise) than coffee or energydrinks.

Abstract
Rationale:
Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM—lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins) are produced via the enzymatic conversion of essential fatty acids, including the omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid and n-3 docosapentaenoic acid. These mediators exert potent leukocyte directed actions and control vascular inflammation. Supplementation of animals and humans with essential fatty acids, in particular omega-3 fatty acids, exerts protective actions reducing vascular and systemic inflammation. Of note, the mechanism(s) activated by these supplements in exerting their protective actions remain poorly understood.
Objective:
Given that essential fatty acids are precursors in the biosynthesises of SPM, the aim of the present study was to establish the relationship between supplementation and peripheral SPM concentrations. We also investigated the relationship between changes in plasma SPM concentrations and peripheral blood platelet and leukocyte responses.
Methods and Results:
Healthy volunteers were enrolled in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study, and peripheral blood was collected at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours post administration of placebo or one of 3 doses of an enriched marine oil supplement. Assessment of plasma SPM concentrations using lipid mediator profiling demonstrated a time- and dose-dependent increase in peripheral blood SPM concentration. Supplementation also led to a regulation of peripheral blood cell responses. Here we found a dose-dependent increase in neutrophil and monocyte phagocytosis of bacteria and a decrease in the diurnal activation of leukocytes and platelets, as measured by a reduction in adhesion molecule expression. In addition, transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood cells demonstrated a marked change in transcript levels of immune and metabolic genes 24 hours post supplementation when compared with placebo.
Conclusions:
Together, these findings demonstrate that supplementation with an enriched marine oil leads to an increase in peripheral blood SPM concentrations and reprograms peripheral blood cells, indicating a role for SPM in mediating the immune-directed actions of this supplement.

I don’t know anything about actual liquid gold as a method of treatment for AS, but I was diagnosed at 16, currently 24. I was very lucky to have a doctor who encouraged me to research and understand my illnesses and provide me with the resources to do so. I have also tried every biologic on the market approved for AS in the US (anti-TNF inhibitors Enbrel, humira, Cimzia, Simponi, remicade; IL-17 inhibitor cosentyx) as well as methotrexate (DMARD). There is a large number of posts about all these drugs over at r/ankylosingspondylitis
In fairly elementary terms: AS means your immune system is overactive, attacking the joints/spine, and causing all your symptoms. The only way to slow disease progression and prevent further damage is to impair the immune system using anti-TNFs or IL-17 inhibitors. Methotrexate (often abbreviated MTX) is sometimes combined with a biologic to create an adjuvant effect and prevent antibody production—your immune system knows there’s something in your body trying to impair the immune system, and the IS thinks it knows best, so it can (no guarantee) produce antibodies to neutralize the medication’s effectiveness. Doctors also prescribe muscle relaxers or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to help with pain/inflammation, but NSAIDs do not in any way affect the disease process: just because you can’t feel it doesn’t mean damage isn’t being done. NSAIDs alone is not treatment. It’s denial.
If you read the little drug fact sheet or listen to the commercials on TV, biologics sound terrifying. This is your friendly reminder that any side effect reported during clinical trials has to be reported to consumers...so if a participant gets the flu and is vomiting everywhere, nausea/vomiting is now a side effect of the drug, even though we can’t prove whether it was the drug or the flu. These drugs go through rigorous testing to ensure safety and efficacy. Your doctor would not prescribe a drug that hasn’t been proven to be safe and effective. Stick with the drugs.
Eating better, losing excess weight, and exercise are all proven to be helpful in improving quality of life and decreasing pain in AS patients. Some people (myself included) use massage therapy for pain management for incredibly tight muscles. Heat or cool compresses help too—different strokes for different folks, but I prefer heat for pain/stiffness and rarely use ice packs. That’s as much “alternative therapies” as I can buy into. No amount of acupuncture or dietary supplements can reverse joint damage or undo a screwy immune system.
Work with your doctor. Ask for resources to do your own research so you can learn and advocate for yourself. Stay active, but don’t overdo it. Get you a biologic that works (it might take several drugs before your find The One) and take it faithfully.

811,2020-01-18 12:15:00,Is it possible to protect oneself from a viral spread like the mystery virus in Asia?,"
As far as I know it is unclear if this virus spreads in respiratory droplets or as an airborne particle. But SARS was airborne and I will assume the worst that this is airborne. Read more on differences between airborne and droplet precautions.
Mask To be conservative, wear an n95 mask. This may be overkill as most viruses only need droplet precautions (surgical mask only) but SARS did spread as airborne particles so let’s assume the worst: wear an n95 mask that fits you. If you have a beard or I’ll fitting mask you are comprised. A mask also limits the behavior of touching ones mouth with infected hands.
Eye protection glasses are fine. Sunglasses are fine. Safety glasses etc. People coughing around you misting fine particles of infection can hit the mucous membranes in you eyes and cause infection . Also stops you from taking your hand and touching your eyes.
Wash your hands! Stop touching your face! Before you eat. Before and after you take your mask/goggles off. After you have touched an exposed person or anyone you are suspicious about. When you return home.
Again, you take a dirty hand to itch your eyelid you just ruined all your protection. Stop it,
Limit outside contact. Think of ways to not go out with a lot of people being there. Shop off hours. Skip timmys birthday.
Quality HEPA air filters . Especially in areas where people enter your house . I use [Honeywell Allergen Remover](Honeywell Allergen Remover, HPA200, Black https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BWYO3EM/ ) . It’s not perfect but will run the air through a HEPA filter . Make sure you buy adequate for room size.

Boost your immune system. Get sleep. Start consuming elderberry. Eat fermented honey garlic. Echinacea supplement.
Decon - Light or strict.
Light is to take off your shoes outside. Take off clothes, throw in hamper , shower immediately on return home . (This is not a bad idea),
Strict would entail building a decon shower outside your home. Not letting people into your house without taking off contaminated clothes and taking a shower and changing into clean clothes. (This is overkill at present)

817,2020-09-27 08:05:00,Dr. Fauci says to take vitamin D if you're deficient,"
Just a word of caution, people: don’t take it if you’re not deficient and if you are, don’t take too much for an extended period of time. It could increase your risk of developing kidney stones . It increases your dietary calcium absorption (and hence also urinary excretion), which combines with dietary oxalic acid (be especially careful if you take vitamin c supplements, which metabolize into that, and also calcium ones, obvs) to form calcium-oxalate stones or, more rarely, calcium combines with phosphate to form phosphate-calcium stones. I know it can happen cause my mom got some horrible ones for the first time in her life after taking too high of a dose of vitamin D for too long.
These supplements may also increase the risk of and exacerbate autoimmune disease [ 1 , 2 ] in the long run (although deficiency is also harmful), among other harmful effects of the excessive calcium absorption.
So be careful, take just the right amount (daily allowance is set at 800 iU, but you may need a bit more, up to 4,000 IU, if you’re deficient) and just long enough to restore optimal levels, don’t overdo it. Ideally, you may wanna get your daily dose of sunshine in the early morning (in a covid-safe way, of course), so you can raise your D levels naturally and rely less on supplementation.

O artigo "" A Basic Review of the Preliminary Evidence That COVID-19 Risk and Severity Is Increased in Vitamin D Deficiency "" tem uma semana. É uma revisão do que se sabe sobre o assunto, sumariza e relaciona vários estudos (188) e explica várias controvérsias e debates no contexto da Covid, incluindo mal-entendidos relacionados com as doses.
Copio a conclusão:
""The 141 articles (Table A1) presenting primarily biological plausibility evidence overwhelmingly support the assertions that vitamin D sufficiency increases resistance to viral infections and helps prevent every symptom of severe COVID-19 that results in fatalities. They show that vitamin D deficiency can also explain every major risk factor, including the mystery of why children seem relatively protected and why males, the elderly, and people with naturally melanin-rich skin are especially vulnerable.
The 47 studies (Table A2) summarized here demonstrate that vitamin D deficiency explains the geographical differences in COVID-19 case and fatality rates. They provide overwhelming correlational evidence for the hypothesis, and causal evidence as well. COVID-19 mortality was predicted by vitamin D in 16 studies (
) and vitamin D levels or sunlight predicted contracting COVID-19 in 17 (
). Both causal modeling studies and eight chart reviews demonstrated that lower 25(OH)D was linearly associated with more severe COVID-19 outcomes (
).
None of the four objections to recommending universal vitamin D supplements are supported by the evidence. The exhaustive literature search found no vitamin D proponent who suggested that COVID-19 could be completely eliminated with supplementation. Rather than overstating the case, they present compelling evidence that vitamin D deficiency is one factor which increases risk for COVID-19 infection and progression. Although overdoses are theoretically possible, they are highly improbable. The recommended dose by consensus, 2,000 IU/day for adults, is 1/20th the amount that must be taken for many months to risk toxicity (
). The evidence strongly suggests that vitamin D deficiency is an easily modifiable risk factor and correcting it is potentially life-saving. Suppressing this evidence out of fear that the public might believe supplements will make them “immune” to COVID-19 is not only elitist, but it is inconsistent with existing public policy approaches. Many mitigation strategies are publicized. None are seen as conferring immunity.
This succinct but comprehensive review of the evidence found that despite almost complete absence of official government guidelines favoring vitamin D supplements to potentially decrease COVID-19 risk and severity, support among clinicians and other researchers for correcting and preventing vitamin D deficiency with modest daily vitamin D supplementation during the COVID-19 pandemic is very strong, worldwide. The evidence supports recommending 2,000 IU (50 mcg) vitamin D daily for at-risk teens and adults, which is well within safe limits and might dramatically reduce COVID-19 fatalities.""

You don't even know me, so you can't judge me. In a subreddit thats full of hysteria, I think its important to put things into perspective. Therefore, I will reiterate what I said earlier that it's simply not as bad as our dummy leaders would have us believe.
Also, quite frankly I'm sick and tired of the finger wagging about how we need to ""stay home,"" when not one leader has spoken about the importance of diet, exercise, nutrition, and supplementation to help naturally boost your immune system.

If you think he's a poor source for information, consider his role during the collapse of Long Term Capital Management and tell me that he doesn't have some critical thinking skills.
For the record, I check out pro-mask reddits because - while I don't wear a mask myself - I'll change my mind and start wearing one when there's some real evidence to support it. When people use ridiculous arguments like the one above from DemianMusic, or the blanket statement that you simply should wear a mask because ""it's the right thing to do,"" that's a baseless reason for conforming to your government's mandate.
It's easy to control people when they're scared; why are governments giving the impression that this virus is going to wipe out populations of people when that clearly isn't the case? Right from Google: Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment - does that really sound like something to panic over?

Governments are printing ridiculous amounts of money - money doesn't grow on trees so how is that going to be paid? - in the name of helping people during these ""difficult times"" but I don't see the average person benefiting at all?
You live in a corrupt world and I get the impression that the pro-mask population doesn't want to accept that reality. The rich rule government; the rich rule politics; the rich rule period. You're just a pawn in a bigger game.
I'd like to note that science has proven just how effective good nutrition and resistance training is for a human yet most people don't care to do that. Why? Because it takes actual and consistent work for it to be effective. That's why most people don't do it - it's too hard for them. If we had a healthier and stronger - not to mention smarter - population, most people wouldn't be so worried about this virus (like I am). I eat good and I frequently weight train and I don't waste my time at the gym playing on my phone or just killing time. That bring me to another point: if this virus attacks our immune systems, why isn't the media/government explaining to people how to improve their immune systems? Why haven't they introduced some type of immune supplement that doesn't have a list of bullshit ingredients added to it?
Nope, let's not educate people; let's just keep them scared so we can pursue an agenda that fits our [personal] best interests..?

I agree and yes that was incorrect of me but you are further supporting my point. To minimize the virus as much as possible the mainstream media and governments should also have scientifically proven diets, foods, supplements, and activities to keep our bodies and immune systems in the best shape possible.

I have my bachelors degree in Public Health, so when this first came out in March , I believed everything that was being told to us from the CDC or any science based publication. Now not so much . It does seem like a race war is coming due the resurgence of black lives matter and racist white ring nut jobs . To me though it all seems so contrived.

829,2020-09-10 15:35:00,COVID vaccine testing.,"
I just have cursory knowledge on the subject but basically there is no way to 100% know long term side effects of anything without waiting long term and observing them.
The FDA approval process attempts to mitigate these risks. With regards to Covid there are multiple avenues of testing going on. EUAs are emergency use authorizations and allow doctors to treat patients with medication ""off book"" but that medication is already approved for other treatments. Medication isnt always ""safe"" but used to prevent death in some cases where the side effects can be mitigated. The example here is Hydroxychloroquine - it was thought to help people with Sars-cov-2 and was given a EUA. The medication's side effects and dangers are well known but it was thought if it prevents death from the disease the risks were worth it. After studies showed it didnt significantly reduce mortality - the FDA revoked that EUA immediately and the drug was no longer allowed to be used to treat Sars-cov-2, as it has potentially very serious side effects and if its not keeping a statistically significant amount of people alive its obviously not worth giving to people.
There are a bunch of medications being tested for efficacy in treating this novel coronavirus, all of which are already approved drugs, things like antivirals are the most common but they are also testing supplements like NAC, stem cell therapy, immune boosting therapy. All of which are currently used for other viruses or conditions such as HIV. These would be quickest to hit the market if causal efficacy in treating the disease were found because the drugs have already been approved by the FDA and shown to be safe to treat other conditions. Even things like ibuprofen are being tested for efficacy on treating the disease. Ibuprofen carries risks of internal bleeding at high doses or when mixed with some underlying conditions or other medications (hemophilia, clotting disorders, anti clotting medication) - so it can kill you, however in small doses without those situations its pretty safe and people all over the country pop a few for a headache. I wont get into whether or not that's ""healthy"" but it is certainly ""safe.""
Vaccines are a bit different. Most vaccines work more or less the same. The science behind them varies but we know what supplementary ingredients are in them, how viruses reproduce, and the dangers involved. Currently approved vaccines are some of the safest medications we have for anything, really, with one of the only main risks being allergic reactions to them.
A few on the market being tested contain adenoviruses, which is a virus that causes a common cold (rhinoviruses and coronaviruses also cause common colds) - these viruses are genetically modified to contain a Sars-cov-2 protein which stimulates an immune response and allows our bodies to efficiently fight the virus should it enter our system and kill it off before it reproduces to a dangerous level (viral load) that causes symptoms to appear (which is what kills people.) This ""type"" of vaccine has been used for decades, for example with ebola, using a different virus with a modified protein was shown effective. We understand the risks and the other ingredients are used for things like mass production, sterility, etc. We use those ingredients in other vaccines and even though there's a lot of scare around some of the ingredients being unsafe, its scientifically unfounded and at the levels those chemicals are present in the vaccine its about as safe as drinking tap water containing arsenic (which most does), which is to say, safe.
Moderna's vaccine (and one other being tested) uses messenger RNA (mRNA) to basically do the same thing. Unlike DNA mRNA contains instructions to produce the viral protein for the cell, so it enters the cell and the cell produces the protein and it stimulates the immune response. The thing about mRNA vaccines is that it would be the first of its type if it is approved. This makes people wary of it, but the science is sound. Although we dont 100% know if this could lead to long term problems, mRNA vaccines have been tested for years, just none have been approved because they havent been as effective as the synthesized protein in a similar virus type of vaccine. The stuff we know about mRNA comes from cancer research mostly, but if its approved, the technology could make a more streamlined and easily produced vaccine that couod work even better than previous vaccine technology (likely with companies going back and updating older vaccines if possible).
The reason vaccines are so safe is because they stimulate your immune system, and by getting sick which we all do, we naturally do the same thing. The other ingredients that allow it to be produced, shipped, increase the shelf life, and draw multiple sterile vaccines from the same vial, are all safe in the quantities they are used in. There's very little risk.
It is a bit apples to oranges: Chemotherapy and radiation kills cells, its carpet bombing rather than precision strikes on cancer cells, so you knock out healthy cells in an attempt to kill cancer cells faster than they can reproduce. In no way is chemotherapy ""safe"" for bodies, its extremely toxic and people get extremely sick from it and can die. We just unfortunately dont have anything better yet as therapy for cancer, and the thought process is if we lessen the chance of death from cancer, and increase the chance of death from chemotherapy and its side effects, and the net result is a higher survival rate, its a better option than just doing nothing about the cancer. Its a pretty unfortunate spot humans are in with cancer but thats why people dedicate their lives to cancer therapy research, and it has gotten better over the years. Work on it is just slow.
Hope this is a little more information.
Edit: I should add - because vaccines are given to millions of healthy people every year, the safety standards are higher than your average medication. Here's a source of safety governing bodies that control vaccines and some more information - https://www.vaccines.gov/basics/safety

""Boosting"" your immune system isn't really a thing. If you're healthy and avoid becoming malnourished, your immune system will work; if you aren't, it won't. Unless you have a condition that reduces your immune response, taking supplements or medication, even natural herbal stuff, won't supercharge your immune system.
Now, there are lots of things that will make you *feel* better. Chicken soup, ginger, lemon juice, etc. can alleviate respiratory symptoms, and there's no reason not to use those things. But treating the symptom isn't the same as treating the disease.
The only sure way to get an immune response before you get sick is a vaccine.

I’m so sorry to hear that you are going through this for a year. I really encourage you to analyze your lifestyle which includes diet, sleep, and exercise. The whole level 1 basic advice will never help you so I’m going to give you level 100. Get your immune system right.
You’re not only getting yeast infection but you have BV and UTI. This is not a matter of whether which pill you have to take because there is a high chance that you will get these infections again. Your body is screaming for you to pay attention to your immune health. I cannot stress enough how important your diet is. Please cut sugar and carbohydrates. They curb your immune system. Be mindful of carbs because they are basically sugar and does the same thing to your body. Cut out processed food and eat real whole foods. Meat and veggies should be the main aim here. Limit fruits because they are full of fructose.
Exercise is also important here. Try to take dietary supplements that boost your immune system. Vitamin D, and iodine will be your best friend. Do your research on immune system. I cannot stress this enough.
I really hope you get better soon as I was also once in your position for six months until I changed my diet and lifestyle with the help of exercise. I know it’s tough and you might be feeling hopeless but trust me this WORKS.

The suggestion that just taking supplements and that most people have some sort of immunity is the misleading part.

I think everything that lowers general inflammation is helpful in fighting a disease.

Also some studies show that mortality rate is higher if the person suffers from d3 deficiency, so making sure your levels are in range could be helpful.

To keep your immune system in tip-top shape all you really need to do is maintain a healthy, nutritious diet, sleep, and exercise.
Green, leafy vegetables is a good start, plus they'll keep your energy levels up. Spinach once or twice a day along with a serving of freshly cooked vegetables is what I eat. Be sure to take a daily multi-vitamin along with a calcium, magnesium, zinc supplement (zinc boosts your immune system, and calcium and magnesium bonds with it when the body absorbs the zinc).
Sleep is possibly more important than diet. With quarantine and social distancing it's much harder for us to pick up germs from other people of course, but irregular sleep habits and lack thereof will erode the immune system badly.
Exercise is pretty critical too. A good routine of stretching, resistance training, and cardio at least 3 days a week is great for your general health and immune system.

I agree- our antibody test is misleading. T cells are where it’s at and IF you have a healthy immune system that reacted correctly to being infected the first time- you would have those titers so that you would not have symptoms or contract it a second time. For example- there are many kids that get strep over and over and over again in a school year. They may have a somewhat healthy immune system - but for whatever reason ,are completely lacking in strep titers. They then can have injections to help with this - at that point, they no longer get it all the time. Just like the wide variation in symptoms- or lack thereof- immune system response varies widely from person to person. Personally , I’ve never had the flu in my entire life that I’m aware of - I’m 48. Also never had a flu shot. But I get sinus infections like crazy. I’m obviously not the norm - because flu prevention is a HUGE business.
You may have gotten it twice- BUT it is NOT a normal behavior of the virus. If it were - positive cases would be far more insane - as would our hospital stays . They are not. They have stayed at a fairly consistent rate .

855,2020-09-09 14:45:00,Vitamin D and COVID-19: Is something better than nothing?,"
My understanding is that calcifediol isn't ""more powerful"", it's simply (and importantly!) faster acting. Apparently vitamin D3 found in pills takes about a week in your body before it is processed to the form that benefits your body and immune system, but calcifediol is akin to that final form and so it helps your body and immune system much more quickly. Since they were administering vitamin D to patients who are already having symptoms necessary of hospitalization, of course it would be foolish to give a form that takes a week to ""digest"" when there is a faster acting form available.
As for taking common vitamin D3 supplements as prophylaxis and for general immune health, that's perfectly fine and good, it just takes about a week delay to start getting results.
There are a LOT of correlations between vitamin D deficiency and poor Covid outcomes, and little to no peer reviewed, double blinded, 'perfect' studies to definitively determine causation . But every doctor and nutritionist would tell you that your immune system simply will not fight viruses as well if you are vitamin D deficient. Since many people are without realizing it, and you would have to take an absurd dose to overdose (I've read 30k UI every day for months), it's not a bad idea to just take some (5000IU/day is a common suggestion) just for general health. Even better if you get the blood test and can get a specific prescription for how much to be taking.

Google 'beta-glucan vitamin c' and you will find some documentation. The vitamin C will increase the bioavailability of the beta-glucan, so it increases the immune-modulating property of the supplement as a whole.
If beta-glucan is indeed the cause of your allergic reaction you don't want that.

A couple of excellent replies above.I would add the following.Everyone can benefit from nootropics to different extents depending on their situation.I consider immunity,gut health also to be important to get maximum benefit from nootropics.So get one or two of immunity and gut supplements in to maximize the benefits you plan to receive from noots.And also dont forget B-Complex which is a required cofactor for many of the bodies mechanisms.Better to have deposits of B-Vits in your body.

Here's a little stat for you.
No fighter has EVER tested positive as a result of a contaminated supplement that was third party certified.
EVER, NOT ONE
The new ADP is basically ""If you test positive because of a third party tested supplement you wont get suspended.."" great.. it doesnt happen.
​
BUT, this now puts the onus on the athletes to use third party tested supplements. If you don't, if you use random supplements off of the internet and they turn out to be contaminated.. Dont expect much sympathy from USADA
USADA are basically giving a totally hypothetical, non existent group of athletes who test positives as a result of third party certified supplements immunity.
The ones who ignore that advice and test positive because of random internet shit, previously got maybe 6 months. I can actually see their suspensions getting longer.
"
865,2019-11-25 18:58:00,UFC's revised drug policy to combat contaminated supplements,"
Well, first off, I don't think you actually have to use a supplement to be sponsored by it. I don't think all those insta-influencers are actually chugging that snake oil masquerading as weight loss tea, for example.
Second, if you want to enter into a contract with a supplement company which did require that you actually use their stuff, you could just add language to the contract about independent testing of every shipment at their expense and/or they assume liability and pay you $X in the event that you pop and it can be traced to their product.
I don't think it will limit sponsorships to be honest.
Finally and in abt event, even if it did it wouldn't unjust. According to the report, the immunity list of supplements was populated by ""five independent supplement certifiers"" not by the UFC or in collaboration with the UFC's sponsors or partners. In which case, even if it means John Doe Supplements Co. can't as readily sponsor UFC fighters as before, that's almost entirely on John Doe Supplements Co.

Sorry this is probably such a dumb question.
I got my flu shot on Monday, it's now Saturday. I know it takes 2 weeks for it to become effective. My throat has been a bit sore and I usually take immune system boosters when this happens and they have worked wonders for me in the past (I don't want to hear your opinion on this please, even if it's placebo, they work for me).

Acupuncture can biphasically regulate the immune system. This means that the treatments can “boost” (supplement) the immune system when necessary, and calm it down when necessary. It’s hard to explain, especially if she is ESL, so she is probably just using that language to save herself some time and confusion.

Also, a great addition to helping your skin and hormones during this time is seed cycling(look it up ladies it has been a game changer for me) and taking a supplement or tea that is suited for immunity support, as during “that time of the month” especially 1-2 weeks prior a women’s immune system dedicates a great deal of resource in the aid of preparing ones body their Menstrual cycle which leaves your skin barrier and other parts susceptible.

To be clear, I'm only concerned with whether or not they in fact disparaged the importance of getting the flu shot. I don't care much if someone says that their zinc supplement boosts the immune system - maybe it does, I'm not sure. But downplaying getting the flu shot is analogous to downplaying wearing your seat belt. Even though the flu shot is not perfect (due to the ridiculously high mutation rate of flu viruses), having a maximal amount of healthy/eligible individuals receive it at the beginning of flu season is critical for protecting the young, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals in a population. Also, even if you still get a mutated strain of the flu that wasn't covered in the vaccine, it will be less virulent due to its genetic similarity to the strain that was covered.

872,2019-11-15 19:42:00,Another anti-vaxx nurse reported.,"
Just so we are all clear, the flu shot is not at all the same thing as the polio vaccination. There is a difference.
Firstly, if the flu shot was an actual vaccine:
It would be mandates just like any other vaccination. It would also not need to be re-applied every year.
The difference is that the flu virus is incredibly volatile and therefore mutates often. Most other viruses we vaccinate against don’t constantly mutate and therefore can more easily be controlled.
Secondly, the flu shot does not protect you like the measles vaccine or others do. When we vaccinate against we can specifically target the exact disease and protect people from getting the disease all together. The flu shot is all together different. Because the flu virus mutates so much, there are many, many strains out there. Researchers with the CDC (and others) have to make educated guesses each year as to what strains of the flu will be the most rampant and those are the strains vaccinated.
The typical flu shot is quadrivalent, meaning that it protects against 4 flu strains. Typically this is 2 strains of Influenza A and 2 strains of Influenza B. That’s it. If the research is wrong and a different strain takes over, the flu shot does nothing. If the virus mutates mid season, then the flu shot won’t help you.
That being said, I am not advocating for people not to get the flu shot. However, this happens every year, where a bunch of medical professionals get slammed for being “anti-vaxx” because they are against the flu shot. In reality, most of them fully support the effectiveness of vaccines, but find the flu shot to be ineffective or unneeded in some cases.
As a young working professional, many of my peers, myself included, typically will not get the flu shot. I have made this choice for myself for a couple of reasons.
I work primarily by myself in a small office with only a few other people, none of whom have kids. Not being around young kids much eliminates a large amount of chances for exposure. Additionally, if I would get the flu, I (and my coworkers) have a much lower chance of infecting any kids.
I (and most of my coworkers) are pretty responsible about being sick. If any of us are sick, we can easily work from home and usually prevent others from catching our germs. Additionally, we all are pretty anal about keeping the workplace clean and disease free. Hand sanitizer is readily available throughout the office, as well as disinfectant spray.
I, personally, am a mild germaphobe, and I hate being sick. If I catch wind that someone at the office is sick, I will break out the rubbing alcohol, wipe down my desk, door handles, and any other commonly touches surfaces and lock myself in my office until I go home. I also will start dosing up on vitamin c, zinc, and other immune system boosting vitamins and supplements for about a week after similar instances. I don’t like getting sick.
Because I don’t like being sick, I will often forego getting the flu shot because, then I will for sure get sick, even if it is mild and for only a day or 2. I have gone many flu seasons without the shot and not gotten sick.
Because of these reasons, I believe that it is better for me not to get the flu shot. This isn’t going to work for everyone, but there are circumstances where not getting the flu shot is relevant.
Additionally, I would be remiss if I didn’t bring up the fact that the flu shot only protects you against those specific types of Influenza A and B. It does not (I repeat, it does not) protect your against the stomach flu. The stomach flu is not influenza it is Gastroenteritis. So if you got the flu shot to protect yourself from that, you are out of luck.
So before you go witch hunting all of the doctors that are “anti-vaxx because they don’t recommend the flu shot”, realize they are not at all the same thing. Being against the flu shot does not necessarily make you anti-vaxx.
TLDR: pointing out that the flu shot is not a normal vaccine, and being opposed to it is often different than opposing vaccines all together. Also influenza ≠ stomach flu.

I was a field engineer in NYC, and the disease affects my joints so I'm unable to walk, lift, stoop, reach, etc. Also most days I don't feel well enough to work long hours, so can't get full time job thus no benefits. I accepted a low-paying, low-stress job. It's great for my condition. However, they want me to work 38 hours per week in the coming months. But as I'm still a ""seasonal"" employee, they won't offer me benefits.
I need the money as I've run out of savings, and still have some medical expenses as insurance doesn't cover a lot of autoimmune services (i.e. allergy tests, supplements, etc). However, I need the medical attention more as I'm still seeing a dr 2-3 times per month.
I'm fortunate that I'm living with my brother who owns his house, so my monthly bills are pretty low. Would love to start saving again but obviously medical attention is most important right now.

A couple weeks ago I went to the doctor for a cold that would not go away. I had had it for going on two weeks at that point. I was diagnosed with bronchitis and prescribed steroids and antibiotics since it wouldnt go away. I finished all of the meds as prescribed and took my last pill Thursday. I felt really good friday, barely coughing and thought I was finally over it. I woke up Saturday sick all over again with basically identical symptoms to what I was treated to a week prior. Today, sunday, I am miserable. Three days after stopping my meds. I bought some vitamin C pills yesterday in hopes I could boost my immune system, but I already take a multivitamin every day. Is there anything else I could be doing to boost my immune system so I'm not sick this whole winter? I have a kind of physically demanding job that I just cannot do when I'm sick and I need to work. I dont know if I should go back to the doctor either since I doubt there's much else they could do if antibiotics and steroids didnt work.
Info: I am: [23f] 5'5 Caucasian 200lbs
Medications I take are wellbutrin 300mg, topamax 25mg, latuda 40mg, estarylla(birth control) and hydroxyzine 25 mg as needed for anxiety. Plus the multivitamin and now vitamin C pills.

Symptom spotting: No symptoms. Even trying to symptom spot, there is literally nothing. My first BFP was 8 days ago on Nov 7th and my only symptom now is a missed period. If I hadn't POAS, I wouldn't know I was pregnant.
Other (advice/tip(s), freaking out, miscellaneous): I'm in shock that I'm pregnant. I thought we'd struggle because of our ages and husband was desperate for baby to be delivered before he turned 40. The lack of symptoms is seriously freaking me out because the only reason I know I'm pregnant is because I peed on a stick and it came up with two lines. Finally got a serum bhCG result today that shows I'm definitely pregnant which is why I feel I can finally post this, but I've continued checking BBT and HPTs every day since my BFP 8 days ago because this still doesn't feel real.
The only advice I have is that ""just relax and it'll happen"" is a bigger lie than ""Santa exists"". At the time of ovulation, I was finishing up an incredibly stressful Masters and dealing with a house move. I was about to go on an interstate trip to visit a friend and worrying excessively about missing my FW, whether or not I was going to drink alcohol at her party, and breaking down in tears from the social anxiety of meeting a huge new group of people. I was obsessing over my FF chart, reading every single post on this subreddit, and spending hours googling everything TTC-related. I was so stressed that I wasn't even getting 3-hour blocks of sleep overnight, which made me even more anxious because then I didn't know if my BBTs were accurate. I was fielding non-stop comments from family and friends about when I was going to get pregnant. So yes, I had zero chill and still managed to get pregnant. ""Just relax"" is clearly not a requirement for conceiving.

Hi all,
35m here. I have a situation that I’m a little afraid to talk about even though this is anonymous and I’m not sure what approach would be best to take in the dating world.
I’m currently in an on and off thing, but it’s trending towards probably not being a thing at some point which means I may be entering back into the dating pool again at some point.
Which brings me to a point that will be new for me in the dating world. This year, out of the blue, I was diagnosed with HSV-2, which is genital herpes for the uneducated. Needless to say, this has devastated me somewhat. Especially given the fact that I may try to date again soon
My question to the women here is this: how much would this affect your decision in dating someone? I’m very proactive in treating it. I take suppressive pills daily, amino acid supplements that help support my immune system and have zero issue wrapping the tool. I do this with new partners anyway. And, I have zero issue talking about it. This would be key since I wouldn’t want to give it to anyone else so conversation is a given.
I’m terrified that in today’s dating world where people sleep together very quickly I’m going to send otherwise interested women running for the hills.
I have a great job, a solid career path, my own place, stay fit, am solid at conversation and generally approach friendships and relationships with an open heart. But now that I have this virus, I’m afraid none of my other qualities will matter.
In case anyone is wondering, I have no idea where I got this from. The docs told me tons of people have it and don’t even know. It sometimes won’t show for up to 10 years. On top of that, I’ve been getting tested yearly and have never run up against anything like this. The stigma sucks, but I’m hoping women will be able to see past it.
Any advice would be great. I’ve spoken in person to a few women that have it but never other men, so I have no idea how women who don’t have it would react upon finding out.

The only initial side effects I felt was some diarrhea and nausea. The diarrhea kinda stopped after I added Probiotics to the mix. I’ve been having loss of appetite ever since the infecion started and that’s still present too, but Nystatin has worked quite well for me in getting rid of the white lesions on my tongue at least.
My daily routine is something like this:
1) eat a bowl of probiotic yoghurt for breakfast & take a probiotic pill 2) immediately after swish 1/2 tbsp of pure coconut oil in my mouth for 7 minutes, then spit it out and rinse mouth with warm water 3) brush teeth & use tongue scraper 4) wait 30 mins after brushing and then swish Nystatin for 10 minutes and swallow. I started by swishing for 3 minutes only but figured doing it for longer might do some good.
One important thing is to either use a new toothbrush every day or to submerge it in a bit of water with some Nystatin until the next time you brush. Make sure to rinse thoroughly after taking the toothbrush out of the solution.
5) Brush teeth immediately after every meal so that no food remnants remain in your mouth at any time.
6) take another probiotic pill with dinner as well as a multivitamin supplement to boost the immune system
I use Nystatin about every 4-5 hours. I try taking it after meals so that it stays in my mouth undisturbed for as long as possible. Hope that helps, good luck to you!

Also excessive sugar intake can cause spikes on insulin that exacerbate inflamation in the body. I think changing sheets is a minor step that doesnt help in severe cases.

So the one thing I see here that is a problem, the certified supplements. So these companies basically get a boost (though small) in purchases and fighters with sponsorship from non certified supplements would be at a disadvantage.
Fighters who use the certified supplements are immune to punishment if their supplements test positive but if a fighter goes with a non certified supplement company for sponsorship reasons they run the risk of them testing positive and then getting a suspension.
It's a slippery slope that UFC will charge for these supplement companies to be certified and preferred fighters get sponsorship on these companies to help hide use (Jon Jones).

Help your mom focus on herself. It’ll be really, really hard. My situation is a bit different (mother is the addict-her mom raised me), but it comes across as the same, I think Start setting aside a couple hours a week for you two to have dinner or lunch alone, and just keep the conversation centered on her. Learn as much as you can about her, and don’t let her derail into your brother. It’s so hard for moms to do it sometimes, but try to remind her that she’s a person outside of her son. Bring more little things in as well, maybe a hair appointment or getting her nails done? She truly does deserve it. As for her health, ash her to see a doctor, as she’s putting her body through a lot right now. If she won’t go, maybe stock up on immune system boosters and vitamin supplements. Melatonin is good for some people who have trouble falling asleep, but also potassium for heart health and magnesium/manganese, and iron. Add protein if she’s loosing weight quickly. And finally, for your brother. Get this ding dong a lock box, something with a lock on it that he can keep away and out of sight. Is Mom searching his room for the drugs/paraphernalia, or do they just keep popping up around his space? The lock box keep her from actually finding anything, but ultimately I think it’s best for everyone involved if he’s not under the same roof. Like I said, my situation is a bit different-but lots of similarities, and it didn’t go well for me. Bottom line-focus on and love your momma just as much as you can.

She doesn’t like milk but does like almond milk. She occasionally has cheese, but I consider her dairy intake to be less than other children her age.
It’s difficult to know what she’s feeling. She doesn’t complain until she’s really sick. Otherwise I don’t know. If I notice sniffles and lots of swallowing I can only assume it’s post nasal drip and increase nasal saline spray. She can have Flonase also, but haven’t noticed it helps much. Same with chewable antihistamines.
She had terrible acid reflux as a baby. She would often choke on her reflux. She is not a good eater or sleeper, so I also wonder if this is associated?
I’ve worked with disabled individuals that were tube fed, and typically had terrible acid reflux. You could hear it. Many times these individuals would come down with Asthma like symptoms and pneumonia because they inhaled it due to poor motor control of their oral/pharyngeal mechanisms.
I am also going to talk to her dr about this. Kind of wondering if there is a link here, since she doesn’t seem to respond well to nasal sprays and antihistamines (usually make allergy symptoms worse). Same with Singulair, it seemed to make her seem like she had terrible seasonal allergies.

She might take 4 years to get where I was at 1.5 years recovery. But she might be able to expedite the process if she tries a few different changes.
I wanted to share a few treatments that were cornerstone of my recovery and you shouldn't give up hope in treating this injury:
-cranial sacral massage: This was cornerstone of my treatment and its kind of like acupuncture but for the brain. This treatment greatly improved every facet of my recovery including sex drive, ability to handle environmental stress, etc. If she hasn't done it, I highly recommend it. Can't be scientifically proven but if you try it, its night or day how you feel.
-heavy metal chelation: I did the quicksilver scientifics protocol that uses EDTA to pull out heavy metals, and injects cells with glutathione while using clay/charcoal as binding agent for the heavy metals. EDTA is widely used chelating agent with people with heart conditions and is rather safe if used properly with a professional. Day 3 of this treatment, my permanent head pain I had daily for 1.5 years went away completely and it felt like the pressure and brain fog was removed from my head. I used about 6 supplements with a professional and this hardcore reset my immune system and reset my body basically. My libido reset to how I was when I was 18 years old.
-exercise and sauna: I purchased a sauna and started to exercise regularly and these both greatly helped me recover also. Both basically detox your brain and body and I couldn't recover without exercise.

I’m seeing an acupuncturist for help with an autoimmune disease. I really like this acupuncturist and have seen her before for different things. She’s not a chiropractor, she’s a real acupuncturist trainer in China. She keeps telling me she’s going to “boost” my immune system though. People with autoimmune diseases don’t need them boosted. Usually the immune system is damaged and needs re-organizing, but boosting is a big no-no. Is this just acupuncture speak for she’s trying to fix my immune system? She also gave me a supplement list for my specific illness, and I noticed echinacea listed on it. Echinacea has been shown to cause flares and worsening of symptoms in people with autoimmune 😬 I felt amazing after my session (also treated for anxiety and a couple other things) so have def not had any immediate negative consequences. The boosting comment just scared me. Thanks for any insight!

If I currently have flu symptoms, what is my best course of action?
Call your doctor and describe your symptoms. Make sure to take your temperature several times over the course of a few hours to see if you have a fever (it can swing one degree in either direction from the median of 36.5C and you still feel fine).
And then depending on other factors (travel, contact with people who may have tested positive), your doctor may help get you in contact with a local testing centre (Pathcare, Lancet) to pay for a private test outside of the NICD's stricter testing schemes.
Should I stay away from my relatives? Should I double my dose of Medlemon and just ride it out?
You could have the flu. You could have another coronavirus of a different kind with mild symptoms. You could have COVID-19 with mild symptoms (1 in 5 people develop symptoms that require a trip to the hospital).
If you're worried about it, you can choose to self-isolate, and if possible work from home. Take a Vitamin D supplement, it helps boost immune system response. Drink water. Sleep. Wash your hands properly.

I'm not a doctor so I can't tell you about cytokine storms. I am however a researcher who did some work a couple of years ago on curcumin, specifically in encapsulation for drug delivery. This is because despite all the miracles it appears to perform in literature, it's really hard to get it into our body. The bioavailability of curcumin is really low, which means that very little of it will actually be absorbed in your digestive system. If you take a curcumin supplement, all but a tiny fraction is going to go right through your body. So, whatever else you might learn about your immune system or cytokine storms, I would advise against curcumin supplements.

Do your best to boost your immune system (get enough sleep, eat balanced meals, exercise, take supplements if needed). Sanitize all surfaces before and after you touch them. Regular face masks will not prevent the virus but it can help you avoid touching your face and mouth. You can also ask your primary care provider if they have any masks available that you can use as someone at higher risk for this virus.

She goes on to tell me about how in the last city she was in she was right near the nursing home where those people died. But she didn't go near them so she's not worried.

So I'm thinking this is a good time to start focusing on supplements that may have some ability to improve immune system function or have been shown to have a positive effect on cold/flu like symptoms. Obviously there isn't any panaceas or cures but I do think there is a few things that might have positive effects. Seems unlikely that these can reduce the chance of infection but may be able to reduce the severity and length of symptoms.
Personally I'm hedging my bets and taking this stuff prophylactically.
I have started taking:
Epicor
This comment from MYSAD is enough to convince me. Plus this study.
I am using Doctors Best 500mg Epicor.
Quercetin
Can potentially help with pulmonary fibrosis which can be caused by COVID19.
Being trialed for effects against COVID19 specifically.
I am using Now Foods Quercetin with Bromelain. Not clear however if a liposomal preparation would be more useful (used in that pulmonary fibrosis study)
N-acetylcysteine ( NAC )
N-acetylcysteine improves oxidative stress and inflammatory response in patients with community acquired pneumonia
Glutathione and immune function
I'm taking 500mg/day - Generic brand.
Vitamin C
Just taking 1g of ascorbic acid at the moment. Might switch to liposomal if I actually get infected with COVID19
Vitamin D3
Generally just seems like a safe bet and take this anyway. Taking 2000iu/day.
Is anybody else thinking this way and if so what else are you taking or thinking of taking that I haven't covered? I have seen mention of various mushroom extracts too but not using any at the moment - have had bad experiences with Cordyceps in the past.

I cannot answer that representatively yet, maybe in a month or two. From the very few instances I had contact with, there definitely was fear of the virus. Practically everyone actually complied with common sense things like washing hands and social distancing, probably that is not conflicting with their worldview. I think it is not that much of a topic because there is neither active nor passive vaccination for corona at the moment, so there is not much reason to arm the battlements yet. This is in Europe by the way.
I heard someone say that they have a super strong immune system because of the supplements they take (by LR, MLM scheme cosmetics, wellness and pseudomedicine firm), so they are not worried about contracting corona. And yes, firms are actively pushing that idea.

However, taking vitamins won't boost your immune system to the point of being overactive. Also, you shouldn't take more than the recommended dose.

What he wrote regarding the heart was not ""the primary cause"" but ""increase the chance of fatality"", which is true in that the respiratory system gets most attacked by covid, and for adequate resistance the heart, arteries, veins, lungs and alveoli must all be healthy.
Supplements can't cause a point of infection for your body to overreact to
Guess you never heard of histaminergic supplements (most obvious, there are more which impact immune system).
The key to supplementation is to maintain and improve health
Did you mean ""the point/reason of supplementation""? Since most people supplement because they're not healthy, or think they're not... (""the key to"" phrase usually means: ""the most important determining factor needed to achieve or accomplish something"" - healthy people usually don't need to supplement).
I get your point entirely, but it's somewhat misguided. More like offering the advice that people shouldn't jog because falling can harm the joints
Seems you don't. What he means is that people should be more careful with supplements during covid crisis and there's no scientific proof of supplements such as NAC in helping people with covid, no proof of other supps as well...

The masks DO provide protection and they limit spread as well. It’s idiotic to believe that they aren’t helpful for us but the medical professionals need them.

I personally don’t plan to be out and about, as I am a homeschooling stay at home mom- but if/ when shit hits the fan if have to go out I will use a mask. In addition, if a member of the family is sick, they will get a mask to contain any droplets etc. We aren’t hoarding masks, we bought two 10 packs for our family of 6. We aren’t stockpiling medical supplies, we do have pulse oximeters to check the oxygenation in the blood of any of us get sick. It is for peace of mind to be reassured that we don’t need to go to a medical facility because that is the last place I want to be with my family on a regular day, let alone now.

I don’t think there’s any conspiracy here...
While I’ve heard of doctors in the US getting kickbacks from companies to push certain drugs, I think that’s just good ol’ fashioned capitalism and greed at work.
All the information you could possibly want about the benefits of healthy eating, regular exercise and natural remedies is easily accessible. Every library has stacks of books on it, the internet is overflowing with it. Every single time I’ve been sick enough to see a doctor they recommend, before anything else, exercise and a healthy diet as the best preventative. Drink less, stop smoking, minimise stress. The sensible stuff you already knew but probably don’t do properly.
I don’t believe there’s a conspiracy as much as I believe that a lot of people are lazy, like junk food and hate exercising. If you want to learn the esoteric and goverment-supressed secrets of eating ginger and vegies, or going for a brisk walk, it’s all at your fingertips. FFS, everyone KNOWS it already, they’re just lazy sods who like soft drinks and burgers. It’s a copout to try and blame your shitty diet on someone else, be it an individual or a corporation.
And what do you mean ‘teach them to do xxx’? Why does someone need to teach us this, when the information is all just sitting there? If you don’t have enough interest in your own health to even do a bare minimum of reading about it, then I really don’t think your premature death is that much of a disaster. ‘But no-one explicitly told me that eating MacDonald’s every day is bad for me!

Also good luck treating meningitis, haemophilia or cardiac arrhythmia with honey and garlic. While there are many naturally occurring medicines, there are also many conditions that require modern pharmaceutical solutions. Alternatively, one is free to place faith in prayer, essential oils and garlic enemas and see how things turn out.

Supplements may help with your immune function and brain fog.

Also creatine mono-hydrate and a quality unflavored protein powder. Put these in plain, lowfat yougurt with a piece of seasonal fruit and maybe cashews and coconut flakes. Your body loves protein, especially if you are resistance training.

This might be a daft question, but anyone got thoughts on creatine supplementation? There seems to be growing evidence that it does improve immune response... but that ""maybe"" it is rough on kidneys. Shakey evidence given it's likely just increase creatinine on blood results due to increased creatine levels.
Would it cause more load on organs, or potentially increase risk of cytokine storm due to stronger immune response (if that does turn out to be true with creatine), or would there be potentially lower immune system from not taking it (previous caveat applies) in an adult currently taking it?
I imagine the most likely scenario is that it doesn't make any real difference either way, but it's been playing on my mind.

The human thymus gland shrinks or involutes shortly after the teen years. Its production of t cells slows to a crawl. These t cells are part of the immune system.
Naive or unprogrammed t cells run out, lowering the elderly person's immune response. Recent studies have shown that thymus status can be rejuvenated, and the shrinkage reversed, by zinc supplementation, restoring the immune function to youthful levels.

Most of these supplements are evidenced to work for some immune issues and viruses, but not anywhere near as well as proper treatment.
These are safe recommendations until we do find a good treatment or prevention method beyond quarantine/social distancing. Not likely to save your life, but all beneficial if you’re deficient. I’d add D and quercetin/bromelain personally, but none of these will prevent or cure COVID19
Also, deficiencies make you susceptible to more severe symptoms. If you’re eating healthily you don’t need supplements unless they’re to treat a personal need (deficiency, existing illness), or offer you peace of mind.

Call your doctor and describe your symptoms. Make sure to take your temperature several times over the course of a few hours to see if you have a fever (it can swing one degree in either direction from the median of 36.5C and you still feel fine).
And then depending on other factors (travel, contact with people who may have tested positive), your doctor may help get you in contact with a local testing centre (Pathcare, Lancet) to pay for a private test outside of the NICD's stricter testing schemes.
Should I stay away from my relatives? Should I double my dose of Medlemon and just ride it out?
You could have the flu. You could have another coronavirus of a different kind with mild symptoms. You could have COVID-19 with mild symptoms (1 in 5 people develop symptoms that require a trip to the hospital).
If you're worried about it, you can choose to self-isolate, and if possible work from home. Take a Vitamin D supplement, it helps boost immune system response. Drink water. Sleep. Wash your hands properly.

Vitamin Shoppe. They considers themselves an essential facility under the guise of a pharmacy (even though nothing sold there is FDA approved.) They failed to address the severity of the pandemic in a timely manner and failed to provide employees with any proper guidance or cleaning supplies in the last two weeks while stores saw a huge surplus of 5000+ customers who came in for immune supplements. Mind you most stores only have a functioning staff of 3 employees at most at any given time. No social distancing was encouraged, no hazard pay was offered, and the company sick pay/leave model was not updated. The company also hasn’t taken an official stance or posted anything relevant outside very basic corporate sanitized response of “here are some home workouts” to their social pages, and employees only received a brief memo stating “we should remain vigilant in these trying times” and that the “media tends to overhype case stories.”

But still, she would have had to eat it anyway for the test. ANTM just loves to torture those girls. It couldn't have been something inoffensive, like onigiri, or something sweet, like mochi.

Oh but that’s honestly normal.

And watching ASMR videos & taking melatonin to help me sleep. Healthy smoothies packed full of super foods and health powders has helped to level out my stress symptoms. Even just feeding my body immunity boosting ingredients & supplements simmers me down . Makes me feel like I’m doing something helpful for my body at least , should the worst happen.
But it must be difficult to keep your cool on the ground. You have my upmost respect! Not an easy job but very cherished. It’s woefully unacceptable how unprepared they are on the PPE front. Frontliners need the protection most as they’re saving others lives- if medical staff fall sick we have bigger issues. Is it possible for you to call on some local dentists or beauticians to get some supplies? I have no idea why they haven’t made a national plea to do that. Or even other industries & factories that have similar protective uniforms like fire fighters ? I have been using washing up gloves when shopping which I drop in disinfectant. I may even buy some tongs lmao . I know it sounds ridic but maybe even a sanitary pad with some holes could work?
I agree the economy isn’t in women’s favour but we have to keep on pushing coming up with side hustles if need be. Don’t let anxiety or depression limit your views & make you feel totally hopeless- where there is a will there’s always a way.

Energy is always deflationary due to improvements in technology (increases supply) and efficiency (decreases demand). We used to light our homes by burning whale fat, then kerosene. Someone then invented light bulbs, and LEDs. Now electricity is produced from solar and wind, which are rivalling the largest and most efficient coal fire plants in terms of cost. Oil is not immune; it will be supplemented by alternative sources of energy and eventually phased out.
All commodities trade just above the marginal cost of production. You have Saudis who can produce cheaply at $20/bbl. On the other end you have some Permian players who produce at $50/bbl. This suggests absent of a demand or supply shock, oil will trade between $20 and $50.

Be careful boosting your immune system. As someone here has said you don’t want to boost it too high to avoid a cytokine storm.
Genetics come into this as well. There are SNPs in the IL-1beta gene that will increase your likelihood of a severe case of SARS and influenza due to immune hyperactivity. So you actually have to take supplements that suppress that gene instead.

Simple precaution, since most things supposed to ""boost the immune system"" (how vague that is...) are actually worsening your condition in a context of cytokine storm, that's the thing that killed not the elderly, not the young, but the healthy adults. The more your body answer to the virus, the worst it gets.
For the young they are mostly asymptomatic and the elderly they drop dead from pneumonia and even more easily if they are smokers, have asthma, sleep apnea..
But before infection i remember things like vitamin D are supposed to limit the capability of the virus to bind (i'm legit tired and nope not gonna search the ref before sleep). If you are already infected you are way past preventing it, and then the idea of precaution, i don't know if they are gonna worsen the condition or not so i don't take them.

The only real problem here (which is a big big issue) is not how dangerous this virus is but now many people need intensive care. For the majority of the population it actually is a bad flu (and if I have it, I can confirm), but ~10% of the current infected needs respiratory aid. We do not have so many intensive care beds, no country on earth does because normally they're not needed. This means that the WHOLE healthcare system is revolving around covid-19, every other not essential treatment is suspended. The only things guaranteed to continue are chemotherapy and dialysis, a lot of people with pre existing conditions, whether already detected or not, may suffer from this, and that's why I'm suggesting you to prepare if you are. It's not so unlikely that the same will happen also in the USA, and I hope the private healthcare situation will not make too many victims.
Anyway, I strongly suggest everyone with any symptom sets aside his/her diet right now, this thing is unknown to our body and we need energy to fight it. I'm currently trying to eat at 100 kcal surplus, but it's difficult because I'm not hungry. I'm in constant contact with my doctor, who is required to phone me once a day, also to check I don't leave the house. He's prescribed me a strong vitamin C supplement to try raise immune defenses, I don't know if maybe it's something you can do for prevention also.
Also, watch this for a mathematical explanation of what is happening.

Boosting your immune system with supplants will not trigger an autoimmune disease. Show me a peer review article proving it, but I have never been able to find that.
I never said it would. I said a boosted immune system attacks the body when it shouldn’t. I specifically said that you can not boost your immune system with supplements. If you can’t boost it, how the fuck will supplements cause autoimmune disease?
My managers husband got Lupus after a staph infection from a surgery.

Lupus- like disease in Mice . Not humans. Your claim has little to support it.
Your claim that you developed ankylosing spondylitis following a tick bite has almost no evidence to back it up, short of claims people make regarding chronic Lyme disease, which isn’t a thing.
So: supplements are snake oil. If you buy supplements for something other than what a doctor diagnosed (and I mean a doctor, not a naturopath or chiroQUACKtor or anything like those chuckleheads) like vitamin D deficiency, you’re buying snake oil and you’re promoting snake oil.

Cytokine storm from increasing your immune system through supplements, or side effects such as cardiac complications from NAC for example, could increase the chance of fatality for someone attempting to help themselves during the covid outbreak. I want to suggest and take advice as much as the next person, trust me, but there is really no research on any supplement out there with this virus specifically, the only exception being studies on vitamin C in China which used 30,000mg intravenously, that’s 60 oral tablets equivalent and intravenous in their study was said to be 10X more effective, meaning even vitamin C orally can hardly be recommended.

Kinda? I've always been pretty good about taking vitamins, and cleanliness. I've been taking more supplements to boost my immune system, and have been watching what I eat more.
I guess I should probably be wearing a mask. I probably interact with about 200 people in the first 4 hours we're open, not to mention I stock all the fresh produce. Gloves probably aren't enough, even if I don't sneeze or have a cough.
It depends on what you're looking for. Right now, I'd start looking early for pasta, canned goods, and fresh meat. We've also had issues with certain types of milk if you/the people you're shopping for are picky. I was told the dairy farms are prioritizing 2% over all the other types, but we've been able to get in 1%, 2%, and whole in the full gallons. The only one we've been REALLY limited on is the full gallons of skim. We have gotten half gallons, but not enough to make up for the demand. A lot of people are also surprised about our bread selection. It takes like a week for bread to be ordered/come in. That should (hopefully) balance out in a couple more days, but it's still pretty hard to gauge.

This is because Vitamin D is, in fact, tied to your immune system, but not in the way that they think. When your Vitamin D levels are low, like mine are, taking Vitamin D supplements can help your immune system return back to normal strength and taking a slightly elevated dose can boost your immune system a small bit. However, it is also fairly easy to overdose on vitamin D supplements and you really shouldn't be taking them unless, like me, you have an actual vitamin D deficiency which can and does lower your immune system significantly without the supplements.

The evidence is very far from conclusive, but it's possible that vitamin D supplementation may help protect against COVID-19:
""Currently, there’s no cure or treatment for COVID-19. No studies have investigated the effect of vitamin D supplements or vitamin D deficiency on the risk of contracting the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
Still, multiple studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency can harm immune function and increase your risk of developing respiratory illnesses.
Additionally, some studies have indicated that vitamin D supplements can enhance immune response and protect against respiratory infections overall.""

Hi all!
I’m (F19) about to go take a walk with my BF (M20) of three years to try one last time to talk him out of his MLM. I am so glad I found this subreddit and I have learned a lot from my last post, which I thank people endlessly for giving their advice! I’m going to try to question him at first about the company and ask if he has done any independent research at all whatsoever. I know that he’s done zero. I watched the Netflix documentary ‘Betting on Zero’ the other day and I couldn’t help but feel guilt about not trying (once again) to get him out of something so bad and manipulative. This will be the third time I’ll be talking to him about it. I honestly hate bringing it up. But after today, if he still values his mentors opinion over mine... I’m leaving.
I hate how he thinks that his “mentors” are the BEST EVER. Like nothing they say can ever be wrong. Little does he know is that he is the reason for their income. It’s sad because my boyfriend is really really smart. Or at least I thought so, until he joined this. I wish he never got introduced this stupid business plan because right now I’m not only going to lose my boyfriend but my best friend. I don’t get how he doesn’t see that it’s a TRAP. I know this is going to end badly. I don’t see it going any other way. It’s so sad to say that I might have to break-up with someone who I love and care about SO MUCH over something as stupid as an MLM... but I tell myself that he’s still young and obviously immature. I hope after today he realizes how bad this is. I hope he puts himself into my shoes and thinks about how much research I’ve done out of my own schoolwork in order to try to get him out of being scammed. I also hope that I can be strong enough to tell him I have to leave, if he continues to choose and protect this company.
I couldn’t sleep at all last night because I’m honestly scared to have this conversation. My gut feeling is telling me that it’s going to end badly. But I know I need to do it. I don’t know if there’s anyone out there who is in the same boat I am. But after reading this subreddit, I realize that I’m better than an MLM. If he doesn’t see that then his loss I guess. If he wants to post on FB when he’s older about all these supplements that boosts your immune system, let him. If he sees this company as a full-time career for his future... his loss. I can’t sit back anymore and listen to his stories and continue to feel genuinely embarrassed. I can’t listen to him talk about this bs TRANSFER FACTOR. And I CANNOT let him choose his mentor’s opinions (OF 6 months if I might add) over MINE (his GF of 3 years). If there is no trust, there is no relationship. It breaks my heart... but I cannot endure it anymore. I wish these MLMs were STOPPED!!
I found this Quote: on this subreddit and I wanted to share it again.
‘It is easier to fool people than to convince people that they have been fooled.’ — Mark Twain
Good luck to those fighting the huns out there. After today, I wish i could somehow raise awareness over this type of stuff. So many people get sucked in and it’s because they’re simply uneducated about it. I shouldn’t have to lose someone I truly care about over this.

I have an auto immune disease. Ankylosing spondylitis.
Lupus, MS, etc are NOT boosted immune systems. They are malfunctioning immune systems. There is a genetic factor to all of these diseases and they are triggered by an event, usually an infection.
Boosting your immune system with supplements will not trigger an autoimmune disease. Show me a peer review article proving it, but I have never been able to find that.
Mine was triggered by an infection from a tick bite. My managers husband got Lupus after a staph infection from a surgery. We have to take medicine to suppress our immune system because when it’s at its normal level, it attacks our bodies. If you have a normal functioning immune system, you probably don’t need any supplements. I take a lot of them to help mine keep from destroying me and they have my disease in remission. OP didn’t state whether they have an underlying condition or not. Please be more thoughtful. Not all supplements are snake oil and many help immensely with chronic disease.

The response to this virus has been pretty bizarre. It's like somebody decided it would just be a really big hassle to try to slow the spread, and it would scare a lot of people in the process--so let's just let this thing burn its way through the population, and we can look back and say, ""gee there sure are a lot of people dying from viral pneumonia!""
The sad reality (in my admittedly unprofessional opinion) is it's here, it's spreading, you're probably going to get it, and it probably won't be that bad. I think, beyond the whole ""wash your hands"" PR thing, it's smart to preemptively try to build up your immune system. Eat healthy, get plenty of sleep, take vitamin C supplements. If you catch the virus your immune system is basically the only thing that is going to protect you at this point. Also, I am actually avoiding strenuous exercise, as I have seen quite a bit of anecdotal evidence that the young, healthy people who get seriously ill had recently done something physically demanding that taxed their cardiovascular and immune systems (i.e. ran a marathon or whatever)
I wish I could say we might learn something from this pandemic that could help us when a more serious one breaks out, but my realistic side knows it is only exposing how much of a hollow shell our society really is :/

""At a physiological pH and 37°C, zinc gluconate for example, releases high amounts of ionic zinc, whereas zinc aspartate releases none (108). Upon examining only the relevant studies where high doses of ionic zinc were used, a clear reduction in cold duration of 42% was calculated (109). Whether this was caused by viral inhibition, improved local immune response, or an amelioration of symptoms remains uncertain.""

interesting comment:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/fj7q0v/potential_interventions_for_novel_coronavirus_in/fkmfatw/
Its a lot of speculation (eg in vitro references). In terms of commonly available stuff that is relevant to us:
As shortage of B vitamins may weaken host immune response, they should be supplemented to the virus‐infected patients to enhance their immune system. Therefore, B vitamins could be chosen as a basic option for the treatment of COVID‐19.
The COVID‐19 had been reported to cause lower respiratory tract infection, so vitamin C could be one of the effective choices for the treatment of COVID‐19.
The virus‐infected people might have insufficient vitamin D. In addition, the decreased vitamin D status in calves had been reported to cause the infection of bovine coronavirus.27 Therefore, vitamin D could work as another therapeutic option for the treatment of this novel virus.
In addition, the decreased vitamin E and D status in calves also caused the infection of bovine coronavirus
Therefore, Omega‐3 including protectin D1, which served as a novel antiviral drug, could be considered for one of the potential interventions of this novel virus, COVID‐19.
In addition, the combination of zinc and pyrithione at low concentrations inhibits the replication of SARS coronavirus (SARS‐CoV).44 Therefore, zinc supplement may have effect not only on COVID‐19‐related symptom like diarrhea and lower respiratory tract infection, but also on COVID‐19 itself.
Baur et al121 also found that α‐lipoic acid (ALA) was effective to inhibit the replication of HIV‐1. In summary, we speculate that ALA could be also used as an optional therapy for this new virus.
IMO anyone up on their game should:
- Have adequate levels of vitamins, specifically B, C, and E, from their diet, and if diet lacking (eg vegetarian = B12), then supplement as needed.
- Be supplementing D at this time of year (depending on your location, and your tested blood levels)
Then you can add zinc on top of that, at the first sign of symptoms?
TLDR: inject scorpion venom directly into your heart.
Mucroporin‐M1 is a scorpion venom‐derived peptide and has broad‐spectrum virucidal activity against many viruses including measles, influenza H5N1 viruses, and SARS‐CoV.

Okay..
A) contribution of ascorbate (vit C) to urinary oxalate (crucial constituent of most types of kidney stones) is controversial
B) the relationship between Vit C and kidney stones is correlational, not causal, lots remains to be studied. You can't just conclude you had kidney stones from vit C
C) 500 mg is nothing. Tolerable upper limit (daily) is 2g for normal adults
D) 5 days is nothing. You need to longer to develop kidney stones
E) studies on this are suggesting that patients actively forming calcium oxalate stones may be susceptible to worse outcome and more kidney stone formation by ingesting large amounts of Vit C chronically
F) don't even get me started on the controversy of whether vit C supplements help your immune system in any way unless you're deficient.
Conclusion: you had a serious bout of pain while urinating. This could be an indicator of any number of diseases or deficiencies. You cannot conclude vit C caused this, and if it did, then you are either currently forming kidney stones or are susceptible to do. Therefore, you need to see a physician and get tested and imaged. The internet is no place for a diagnosis, and correlation =/= causation.

Vitamin Shoppe - They considers themselves an essential facility under the guise of a pharmacy (even though nothing sold there is FDA approved.) They failed to address the severity of the pandemic in a timely manner and failed to provide employees with any proper guidance or cleaning supplies in the last two weeks while stores saw a huge surplus of 5000+ customers who came in for immune supplements.
Starbucks - They cracked under the pressure and finally decided to give their employees paid time off, but still deserve to be on the list because it took employees publicly ""crying for help"".
Goodwill Colorado - Asking people to take time off from their own vacation time and just reducing store hours.
Bombardier aerospace - ""No signs of shutting down but we are allowed to take time off without pay. Planes aren’t flying but we still have to work.""

Vitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory tract infections: systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data Abstract Objectives To assess the overall effect of vitamin D supplementation on risk of acute respiratory tract infection, and to identify factors modifying this effect.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data (IPD) from randomised controlled trials.
Data sources Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number registry from inception to December 2015.
Eligibility criteria for study selection Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trials of supplementation with vitamin D3 or vitamin D2 of any duration were eligible for inclusion if they had been approved by a research ethics committee and if data on incidence of acute respiratory tract infection were collected prospectively and prespecified as an efficacy outcome.
Results 25 eligible randomised controlled trials (total 11 321 participants, aged 0 to 95 years) were identified. IPD were obtained for 10 933 (96.6%) participants. Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of acute respiratory tract infection among all participants (adjusted odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 0.96; P for heterogeneity <0.001). In subgroup analysis, protective effects were seen in those receiving daily or weekly vitamin D without additional bolus doses (adjusted odds ratio 0.81, 0.72 to 0.91) but not in those receiving one or more bolus doses (adjusted odds ratio 0.97, 0.86 to 1.10; P for interaction=0.05). Among those receiving daily or weekly vitamin D, protective effects were stronger in those with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <25 nmol/L (adjusted odds ratio 0.30, 0.17 to 0.53) than in those with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels ≥25 nmol/L (adjusted odds ratio 0.75, 0.60 to 0.95; P for interaction=0.006). Vitamin D did not influence the proportion of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event (adjusted odds ratio 0.98, 0.80 to 1.20, P=0.83). The body of evidence contributing to these analyses was assessed as being of high quality.
Conclusions Vitamin D supplementation was safe and it protected against acute respiratory tract infection overall. Patients who were very vitamin D deficient and those not receiving bolus doses experienced the most benefit.
Not 100% clear if this would hold true for the coronvirus/covid-19/Sars-COV-2 but.

xiaolong hit on most of it. It's worth mentioning that while there's no medical evidence that you can strengthen your overall immune system (it's one of the most complex body systems out there- supplements that claim to strengthen it make about as much sense as someone claiming they can make the airport run better by increasing the electricity in the wires at the airport) - it IS possible to have a weak immune system. People taking certain medications, or who are pregnant, or who have certain diseases, or who are ingesting cellular poisons like smokers do, can absolutely have a worse immune system. To use the analogy above, you can't make an airport run better by turning up the electricity to the airport. But if you cut the electricity supply to the airport in half, you can certainly make it function less well.
The bottom line is that for a healthy person eating a reasonable diet, there's no such thing as an immune boosting pill, and any claims to the contrary are snake oil.

That means, with daily Vitamin D supplementation (NOT sporardic) the adjusted odds ratio is 0.88. Which is huge. Any number less than 1 here means it's protective. That means for a nornal person, they have 19% less chance of getting chest infections.

Usually you're okay if your fever is gone. Literature I've seen says to give yourself 72 hours after the fever, regardless of cough. Try to stay healthy and boost your immune system. Oregano is a fairly potent anti-viral and they have supplements in concentrated liquid form. Garlic would be great to consume in larger quantities.
The highest risk of COVID-19 right now is complications from SARS, particularly pneumonia. Please take care of yourself and your lungs. Pneumonia is pretty terrible and you want to avoid that at all costs. Your fever can return, so make sure you are still resting and recovering. If no fever in 72 hours, you should be in the clear!

EDIT: Just to clarify, I don't want to instil panic, but this information should prompt people to come up with a serious and practical plan for your situation. For example:
Assess your current finances and how you would handle a quarantine situation. Assess whether you are in a position to stay away from gatherings/workplaces/etc. and make a decision now or write up a checklist that would trigger this decision to not go to work, etc. Have a sufficient supply of food at home including other necessities, such as essential medicines, paracetamol, etc. Start on fortifying your health/immune system.

It mentions ECGC (present in green tea if you don't have) and the combination of Statins and... Cafeine.
I have some ECGC laying around and i have red rice yeast (acting as a statin?) and of course Cafeine.
So... That being said i think the classic Vit C, D & Zinc are for before the infection, if you are already infected you should stop zinc. Wait a bit for your body to do it's magic and then if you are middle-aged (32yo), push a little on the brakes with some anti cytokine storm method. Problem is... what is safe? What dosage? What drug? How effective they are? Or more joyous things like ""yeah the statins + cafeine thing... definitively gonna augment my body temperature"".

Practically everyone actually complied with common sense things like washing hands and social distancing, probably that is not conflicting with their worldview.

Avoid public places. Keep people at an arms distance. Avoid physical contact.

It spreads through droplets. Medical places are hotspots for corona virus, carry a sanitizer at all times. Wash hands till elbows frequently, for 30 seconds ( approximately happy bday 2x times, sing it to pass the time. Lol.) Please👏don't👏be👏ashamed👏to👏wear👏a👏mask👏 Stop being nervous about looking stupid, don't forget this has no cure yet. Keep anti biotics in stock. Keep your immune system healthy, have vitamin C (nimbu, tablets etc.) Keep the elders of your house away from public, they are at the highest risk of catching it. Only effects 0.1% of kids. Use sanitizer at all times. Avoid touching your face. I'm a very paranoid person, so I hope this helps, just don't take this too lightly. Precaution is better, there is no cure.

There is some evidence that creatine supplementation may have a negative effect on the immune system:
""forms of creatine down regulate expression of TLR-2, TLR-3, TLR-4, and TLR-7 in RAW 264.7 cells, a mouse macrophage cell line. These TLRs interact with constituents of a wide array of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including lipoteichoic acid (TLR-2), double-stranded RNA (TLR-3), bacterial lipopolysaccharide (TLR-4), and single-stranded RNA (TLR-7). As TLR down-regulation in the host should reduce the effectiveness of the innate immune response in sensing infection, this could result in an immunosuppressive impact and, thus, could be significant in individuals who have compromised immune systems, such as the elderly."" ""the immune response may be dampened in the presence of high levels of creatine""
Source - NCBI - Beyond Muscles: The Untapped Potential of Creatine
However, there is also evidence that (via a different metabolic pathway from the one studied above) that creatine supplementation may improve immunity in the case of cancer cells:
""creatine uptake deficiency severely impaired antitumor T cell immunity. Supplementing creatine to WT mice significantly suppressed tumor growth in multiple mouse tumor models""
Source - JEM - Creatine uptake regulates CD8 T cell antitumor immunity
These studies are not contradictory as their subjects are different, nevertheless they demonstrate that this is not an area with a simple yes/no answer.

I have severe asthma and am super stressed about this whole thing. I’m a caregiver to my partner as well, and if I die, there won’t be anyone to take care of her. 😔
So, I’ve just been doing my best to not go anywhere I don’t have to. Grocery shopping and that’s it, literally. So twice a month I leave my house, not more for anything whatsoever. Ever.
I also purchased, and this may be overkill, but whatever, one of these each for my partner and I, and a package of these , a set for each of us.
I used to work in infection control for the government and have been educated in microbiology and the chain of infection. Also, airborne droplet protection. I have severe OCD and have no problems going to extreme lengths to both feel and be protected.
The filters are p100, so 99.97% of airborne particulate shouldn’t get through, as long as the mask is fitted properly. I was fit tested when I worked for the gvmt so, I knew what my size was. It may be more difficult for you if you haven’t gone through this process. My partner used my mask for a while before the Coronavirus thing happened and she was able to use medium (7502) just fine. It’s better to get fit tested, tho.
If you want to go super overkill, and eliminate organic vapours (scents and various chemicals), you can get this .
All together, for the 2 masks, a 4 pack of p100 filters and 2 packs of cartridge filters, it cost me about 200$ CAD, shipped. Get this now before supply dwindles.
Do I feel safe? Hell yeah I do, but it’s just one of many things I do to protect myself. Hand washing and not touching mucous membranes is crucial to not getting sick, which is why public health officials are stressing it so much. Another thing, go to Costco and get their 4 pack of 99% isopropanol. Then grab a spray bottle like this and fill it with iso. If you have to go out and dont have access to facilities to wash your hands, this will take care of things temporarily . Disinfecting with alcohol is not a substitute for hand washing. The bioburden on your hands needs actual hand washing to be removed, iso is just a stop gap until you can wash properly.
Look up proper hand washing technique. If you have a black light, put them under it after and see what you missed. Not kidding.
Keep your immune system healthy, eat vegetables, stay tf away from sugar, sugar is practically sickness in a pretty package. Also not kidding.
You may think I’m crazy extreme and i will probably get downvoted to hell, but if you want to know how to protect yourself, these are some of the things you can do.
Good luck and stay healthy!
Edit: I take supplements (tinctures) to help boost my immune system and help me breathe easier.
They are: Sinafect , Mullein , and Fennel . These help me immensely with not getting sick and being able to breathe without having to take my combo or salbutamol. It works for me, but everybody is different.
Edit: forgot to mention I’m 37 and am in relatively ok health otherwise.

I woke up one morning over two weeks ago with that ""OH FUCK I have the flu"" feeling. By the way, I have not had a cold or flu in over 10 years. Called in sick to work and haven't left the house since.
Later that day though, I felt perfectly fine. That night, I woke up around 2am. I panicked for a bit because I was really confused. Imagine if you woke up in the middle of the night and realized someone had thrown a bucket of water over you. It was like that except it was just night sweats like I had never had before. The next few days were similar. I woke up in the morning feeling sick (mild fever, achy, occasional headache, just generic flu symptoms) but it would be gone later in the day. After about a week, I started feeling a sensation of cold and dampness in my lungs. I started coughing up phlegm. I am not a smoker, I have no issues with this usually. I started having a dry cough but it was minor. Again, none of these symptoms were ever that intense or lasted very long.
Anyway, that is my story. I am 40 and in relatively good health. I take a lot of supplements and have healthy immunity.
We don't know how long after a person is still contagious so I am very nervous to leave my house. I'm thinking maybe I'll stay here another week at least. I have one mask that I have left over from trying to be safe during wildfire season last year.

Pasted from a comment I gave on another thread:
With regard to immune-boosting claims being made and their relevance to coronavirus:
One of the most common claims made about some food or supplement is that it will ""boost"" your immune system. The immune system is a complex and multifaceted thing, and it is not clear to me what this really even means. Given that many human diseases are the result of the immune system being overactive, ""boosting"" your immune system isn't something you should necessarily want to do anyway.
In CoViD-19 and many other serious infections, part of the problem is the immune system's reaction to the pathogen rather than just the pathogen itself. Overwhelming infections can create a reaction called ""cytokine storm"" in which the chemical messengers that immune system cells use to talk to each other are... well, i suppose ""boosted"", resulting in the inflammatory reaction of the immune system raging out of control. There has been serious discussion in the medical community about whether or not we should use immune suppressants in treating this illness. One of the few times we do try to enhance immune response is when we give immune checkpoint inhibitors for cancer treatment. Interestingly, one of the serious adverse effects we see with this is lung injury that is very similar to what we see in the severe CoViD-19 patients.
OP (from that thread) had been promoting some nonsense on r/covidcookery from Neal Barnard and PCRM about immune-boosting foods.

1142,2020-03-13 19:50:00,Why does the flu go away in the spring?,"
Prevalence of the flu mostly lessens in the warmer months due to a few factors related to people doing things that weaken their immune systems in the winter, not necessarily being in closer quarters with more people (though that doesn't help, to be sure).
The holiday season kicks off with Halloween and then proceeds with higher amounts of junk food and alcohol all the way through New Year's Day. Junk food and alcohol significantly decrease your immune system's ability to fight viruses. People exercise less, which also weakens your immune system. People tend to spend little to no time in direct sunlight, which helps your body naturally generate vitamin D. Unless you take supplements, your immune system has less vitamin D with which to work and is thus weaker. Dehydration slows your immune system response, and the air inside tends to be dryer than the outdoors, especially heated air. Thus, drinking more water would lessen your chance of getting the flu. People tend to get stressed during the holidays which weakens your immune system. People tend to get very busy during the holidays, which means they get less sleep and thus have weaker immune system. There are probably more immune-weakening behaviors that are more common in the winter, but those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head.

Its a lot of speculation (eg in vitro references). In terms of commonly available stuff that is relevant to us:
As shortage of B vitamins may weaken host immune response, they should be supplemented to the virus‐infected patients to enhance their immune system. Therefore, B vitamins could be chosen as a basic option for the treatment of COVID‐19.
The COVID‐19 had been reported to cause lower respiratory tract infection, so vitamin C could be one of the effective choices for the treatment of COVID‐19.
The virus‐infected people might have insufficient vitamin D. In addition, the decreased vitamin D status in calves had been reported to cause the infection of bovine coronavirus.27 Therefore, vitamin D could work as another therapeutic option for the treatment of this novel virus.
In addition, the decreased vitamin E and D status in calves also caused the infection of bovine coronavirus
Therefore, Omega‐3 including protectin D1, which served as a novel antiviral drug, could be considered for one of the potential interventions of this novel virus, COVID‐19.
In addition, the combination of zinc and pyrithione at low concentrations inhibits the replication of SARS coronavirus (SARS‐CoV).44 Therefore, zinc supplement may have effect not only on COVID‐19‐related symptom like diarrhea and lower respiratory tract infection, but also on COVID‐19 itself.
Baur et al121 also found that α‐lipoic acid (ALA) was effective to inhibit the replication of HIV‐1. In summary, we speculate that ALA could be also used as an optional therapy for this new virus.
IMO anyone up on their game should:
- Have adequate levels of vitamins, specifically B, C, and E, from their diet, and if diet lacking (eg vegetarian = B12), then supplement as needed.
- Be supplementing D at this time of year (depending on your location, and your tested blood levels)
Then you can add zinc on top of that, at the first sign of symptoms?

And re. the longevity of the virus on clothing. It's unknown and varies by type of fabric. The purpose of washing is to be precautionary, which is the prudent thing to do given the risks involved and the uncertainty. I'm not inventing these things. It's easy to spray your clothing with soap. Why not do it? Bret Weinstein (an evolutionary biologist who studied under Trivers) advised this yesterday on a livestream with his wife. It's what he does. So I'm not like inventing kooky advice that no one else is following.
The fact that most people recover without symptoms isn't known. We don't have good data on that. Even if it's true, why run the risk of permanent damage?
The list of supplements come from Dr Rhonda Patrick, a very popular PhD guest on JRE. Most North Americans are Vit D deficient, especially since we're at the tail end of winter. It's a logical, low cost supplement. Again, a precautionary approach and the fact that few of us know whether we are deficient would say to take the supplements. Lots of studies on Vit D and immunity, including re. coronaviruses specifically.

Yes, I completely agree. I wasn’t being argumentative at all, just pointing out that even though we do the best we can, some things are out of our control. My hormonal balance was most likely already off. But the main reason I went to the Dr in the first place was because of sudden rapid weight gain with no diet changes. I’m talking 2 lbs a night. Within 2 weeks my clothes didn’t fit anymore. Crushing fatigue. I had been tired for a few years prior, but I thought it was just the stress of running a successful busy company - with my dad and all the long hours that takes. I took supplements to support my immune system, etc, but I was also experiencing muscle pain, again, just chalked it up to being at the computer too much. I was diagnosed with “fibromyalgia” and I just thought “ok sure. Whatever that means.” Stopped working on weekends from home, did some stress management techniques and yoga until one day April 1st 2017. I pulled myself out of bed, went to work, walked inside and I just couldn’t go any further. My body just gave out. I was exhausted. So I did some googling and all my symptoms pointed to hypothyroidism, and possibly adrenal fatigue so I ordered a 24 hour 4 point cortisol saliva test, sent that off and took a 6 week sabbatical. I was sure that I would be rested enough by then. I went to the Dr April 3rd. I didn’t even have a GP because I hadn’t needed one in the 10 years since I had moved back from college. I opened the newspaper, saw a full page color ad in the newspaper for a Dr and it said “same day or next day appointments.” I thought, “oh this is not a good sign. Why is this guy taking out a full page color ad in the Arizona Journal AND takes same or next day appointments. Did he murder someone?” Long story short, I went in, told him my symptoms and suspicions and my previous diagnosis of “fibromyalgia” which I was sure was just a label. Nothing had been tested to rule anything out, so I just didn’t believe that. He sent me for some labs.
He called 4 days later and asked me if I could come in the next morning anytime. He’d make time for me. So I went in, he took me to an IV room, started an IV and while he was doing that he said “I didn’t want to tell you over the phone because I didn’t want to stress you, but you have extreme adrenal insufficiency. I’m giving you a 50mg IV drop of hydrocortisone. Then we talked about my labs. I had several reactivated viruses (EBV, HHV-6, parvovirus, CMV) and had had an exposure to cocksackie. Then he told me I had Lyme disease. I had both IGG and IGM antibodies, which meant I had a previous exposure and also active Lyme disease, alone with several co infections babesia, bartonella, mycoplasma, anaplasma, and Erhlichia, and later found out I had 2 retroviruses (AIDS is a retrovirus). I live in AZ and hadn’t done any recent traveling, although I grew up until I went to high school in South Dakota. I don’t know if I got bit there at some point but I was healthy and my immune system suppressed it (it never fully goes away, antibodies are always there, kinda like the chicken pox), or if I got bit in AZ. I learned a whole bunch of stuff pretty fast. The CDC is full of shit when it comes to Lyme disease. Their stance is no matter how long you have had it, 5 days of antibiotics and you will be cured. That’s a big fat lie. I took 6 weeks of doxy and it did nothing. So the infection I had, I must have had for awhile because if you take 6 weeks of doxy within a few weeks to a month of catching the bite, you have a good chance of being ok. 3 years and $200,000 later, and I still can’t get my immune system back on line still. I have done tons of treatment (none covered by insurance. They cover nothing lyme related, not even the Drs appointments). And I’ve plateaued at like 60% better. My thyroid is still a mess as are my adrenals. So I lurk around here looking for any supplements that might help. I tried the herbal supplement route but it was too much. It was like 50 pills in the morning, noon, afternoon and evening and I was worried I was going to choke on one. Not to mention that’s literally all I did all day. Now I sleep. Cytokine cascades are somehow in the mix. I’ve done glutathione IVs which helped me “detox” my liver, but I’m a loss. You have any ideas??? Any at all?

Call your doctor and describe your symptoms. Make sure to take your temperature several times over the course of a few hours to see if you have a fever (it can swing one degree in either direction from the median of 36.5C and you still feel fine).
And then depending on other factors (travel, contact with people who may have tested positive), your doctor may help get you in contact with a local testing centre (Pathcare, Lancet) to pay for a private test outside of the NICD's stricter testing schemes.

It's sick to eat animals anyway, if we don't have to.
Go veggie and eat only very small amounts and high quality of other animal products, that's one great thing you can do for your health. Eat organic fruits, , vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts/seeds... And you'll see Corona fail against your immune system.
Supplement Vitamin D3 and B12 (no matter if you eat animals or not, chance is very high that you're low on those both vitamins and they are extremely important for your immune system, also you can't really overdose except for going really mad with D3 over a long period).
I havn't been sick in 8 years eating that way, I know that Corona will have no chance against me.

Hate to burst your bubble, but you’re wasting time and money on two things that will do absolutely nothing for you.
Supplements will not “boost” your immune system, because you can’t. And if you could, you really would not want to because the immune system is a very complex coordination of several different factors working together.
Boosted immune systems are in overdrive. Boosted immune systems are what causes things like multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, lupus, etc. The immune system is outnof control and attacking things it should not attack. That is what “boosted” is, and if you could boost it, why would you want to?
Save your money, stop handing it over to snake-oil salesmen and grifters. Stop buying into this supplement and boosting nonsense.

Should I keep stocking up on stuff in case of a quarantine? Should I just lock myself up at home? What can I do to brace myself and my family for this?
First off, don't panic. That's not going to help you any and is just going to weaken you and cause you to make dumb moves. Yes, you should be stocking up for a quarantine as that's a real possibility but whether you still need to stock is going to depend on what you already have and what your financial situation is. Head on over to /r/pandemicpreps and ask them about it. If you can take some time off then I'd recommend doing that as well but again this is going to depend on your financial situation. If you can't afford time off or a ton of more supplies then don't get yourself into a bad spot over them. As long as you have chlorine bleach, hand sanitizer, plenty of soap, disinfecting spray, and maybe some disinfecting wipes (although you can really just use bleach plus paper towels) then you can set up a reasonably effective 'disinfection protocol' for anyone leaving and entering the house. As for your father he should be staying in as per WHO recommendations. Getting plenty of exercise and eating an immune boosting diet would be great too and supplements can't hurt either, especially C and D.

This is incorrect. Mortality is higher than the flu for many age groups under 80. For example, my age group, 60 -69 is estimated at 4.6 percent. which is 46 times the mortality average for the seasonal flu. 30-39 year olds saw a mortality rate of around .2 percent, double the seasonal flu average. Everyone above that age are significantly higher. See link below:

"
1192,2020-03-11 07:57:00,An immune boosting guide I wrote up and would like to share wherever possible. Simple and practical.,"
Last week I made a thread hoping to put together a list of techniques we know of to boost different aspects of the immune system. I am not a doctor, but it is my understanding that if the general population has a healthier immune response, then both mortality and transmission rates could be reduces in the coming months.
""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" and a lot of these suggestions are just too easy and rewarding to pass up. If there was ever a time to change your lifestyle temporarily, now is that time. Especially anyone with rheumatoid arthritis, thyroiditis, hashimoto's, or any other immune system related disease, please heed some of these warnings and prepare your body for the worst case scenario. It's the only one you've got. I don't mean to fearmonger, but multiple of my closest loved ones do have immune issues and it worries me badly. More than I want to process at the moment.
That said, although the biohacking community is known for some pretty outlandish extremism at times, I asked specifically for the simple, cheap, and most commonly viable options. Ideally, most of these should be within reach whether you're a marathon runner or a couch potato (like me). If you don't trust my list, please at least do some googling of your own. I will try to attach some scientific literature to reinforce what I'm saying, but expert advice would be great. Even better would be if someone who really knew what they were doing would make a more comprehensive list, but this is what I've got so far:
Drink water. Get your necessary amount every day. Reduce or completely stop drinking soda. Excessive sugar in general is going to be bad for inflammation which your immune system must devote resources to fighting. This article briefly explains why with many studies linked within the article. It also explains how trans fats, vegetable and seed oils, refined carbs, alcohol, and processed meats have similar inflammatory responses. Ideally you want to ease the load on your immune system and avoid forcing it to fight off the response to your diet.
Get a full 7-8 hour nights of HIGH QUALITY sleep every night. Make your bedroom very dark, turn off the screens an hour or two before sleeping, etc. More info in that link. Sleep is your best friend at times like this. It gives your body a chance to reset and clean up. Right now is not the time to pull all-nighters. You can't keep working if you get very sick, anyway.
Smoking... oof. If you're smoking cigarettes, you really need to try vaping for a while. I'm sure you've heard it a thousand times, but now is the best time of your entire life to give vaping a try. Limiting your vaping would be good, too, but if you need the drug, your lungs will appreciate the break. Here are some potential tips for accelerating that recovery. For the tokers out there (me again), try to reduce your dosage and vape or make edibles whenever possible. The less strain on the lungs the better.
Reduce stressors at all costs. Mindfulness meditation, zoning out to some videogames or a show or a movie, reading a book, breathing exercises like 4-7-8 breathing , anything you can do to make you worry less, relax more, and help you get better sleep. Stress = cortisol = inflammation = bad. Whatever you need to do to calm yourself, do that.
Many vitamins are essential to the immune system. Whether you get them from your diet or from supplements, these are some of the important ones we collected:
Vitamin B6 (+white blood cells, other stuff ) Vitamin C (+white blood cells, other stuff ) Vitamin D ( direct sunlight helps natural production ) ( lower rate of lung infection , other stuff ) Vitamin E (+Tcells, other stuff ) Allicin (Garlic) (antimicrobial, complicated stuff I can't read ) Zinc (immunomodulator, more ) Curcumin (Turmeric) (immunomodulator, more ) Certain probiotics are also known to help. Good yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha, miso, etc. or a supplement with as many strains as you can get. Fermented food is good.
Exercise. Whatever you are capable of. Whether it's planking on your elbows in bed, or doing some yoga or stretching on the floor, or jogging around the block, or lifting weights. Home exercise is best, use your body weight as resistance if you don't have equipment. Dance around to some music by yourself, or goose step around the kitchen screaming in broken German. Hell, hump a pillow until you are sweaty, anything. Just move your body until you are tired a few times a week. Get your heartrate up stretch out.
Fasting. This one is considered extreme for a lot of people, but I can't stress enough how good it is for your immune system and inflammation. This study touches on a lot, but it's worth googling some research for yourself if you haven't fasted more than 24 hours before.
And of course, wash your hands. Antibacterial soaps, alcohol based hand sanitizers, whatever it takes to clean your hands completely. Keep your distance from people. Now is not the time for handshakes, hugs, and kisses. Save your orgies for after we get this under control. Avoid large social gatherings like... the plague, for lack of a better metaphor. Please stop going to events. Garth can wait.
TL;DR:
+Water
-Alcohol
-Sugar
+Sleep
-Smoking
-Stress
+Vitamins B6, C, D, E, Garlic, Zinc, Turmeric
+Probiotics/fermented foods
+Exercise
+Fasting
+Wash your hands
+Keep your distance from people
Good luck to everyone out there, and I hope this saves at least one life. It can if you can find a way to translate this list to anyone that you know might need the boost. Thank you all and let's get through this like it's 2020 and not 1918. Use the tools we have available to spread this information.

Absolutely. Anyone who is still working and interacting with individuals in the public sphere has a much higher chance of infecting those they live with. Even if you aren't showing any symptoms you could currently be an asymptomatic carrier. I recommend you do everything you can at home to distance yourselves from each other and sanitize any common areas you share. Sanitize, sanitize, sanitize. Try researching foods and supplements she can take to naturally strengthen her immune system. There's no cure obviously, but healthy eating and a well rested and nurtured body will be able to fight off this thing much better than someone not taking care of themselves. Even if her getting the virus is unavoidable, you should be doing everything you can to delay that from happening. No time to panic, just take extra precautionary steps and take care of yourselves. Wish you guys the best OP.

Have you been tested for Lyme? I have had lupus since 2012, but in May of '19 i lost the ability to walk, my blood pressure bottomed out, my headaches were blinding and i was dizzy and nauseous. The blood work and scans were all clear so essentially the Drs thought it was all psychsomatic. Lyme can cause the CRAZIEST of symptoms. I went holistic, with testing of minerals, toxins and parasites. I was completely unbalanced with all nutrients. I'm doing the Autoimmune paleo diet and taking about a billion supplements (very expensive) but feeling better than i have in years. I had also been diagnosed with cervical dystonia, so that's worth looking into as well. I'm so incredibly sorry that you're operating blind.

It has spread, but in different countries. It doesn't affect those with healthy immune systems because the virus attacks the air pathways, therefore constricting your bronchial pathways to your lungs. The by product is that your lungs can't fight the reduced oxygen and the white blood cells needed are not in abundance because starving your body.
Consistent with previous reports 14 , serum from DIV-vaccinated aged mice also failed to neutralize SHC014-MA15 ( Supplementary Fig. 5c ). Perhaps most importantly, DIV vaccination resulted in robust immune pathology ( Supplementary Table 4 ) and eosinophilia ( Supplementary Fig. 5d–f ). Together, these results confirm DIV vaccine failure and illustrated augmented disease for the aged vaccinated group.
That's why the healthy are not a victim initially, it's similar to the flu or cold.
The second part is important, we need to not propagate the virus from using our healthy bodies as hosts to mutate further. That's why containment is important regardless of your health. We can self heal for the most part, unless it gets to mass levels of infection and mutation then we would be at risk as it would then modify into other issues outside of lungs.

Yet another person here wanting to supplement with good immune boosters during this pandemic. I’m currently recovering from Flu A and trying to take care of myself as best as possible so I don’t get pneumonia. I have asthma also, so getting and remaining healthy is a huge priority right now. I’m unfamiliar with supplements and vitamins in general but have been recommended the following:
-Mullein (330 mg) -sea moss (1000 mg) -turkey tail mushrooms -vitamin d (I’m not sure what dosage yet—I have never been tested for a deficiency but wouldn’t be surprised if I am since I hardly ever go in the sun and my diet is pretty bland)
I currently take -vitamin c (I take this regularly) -elderberry (been chewing a few gummies every day for the past few months -NAC 600mg (I’ve been taking this every day for about 2 weeks now
Any other recommendations? Anyone see any problems with taking all the above? I have extreme health anxiety and even taking new vitamins worries me. I worry about creating a cytokine storm in my body by over stimulating my immune system, but I also want to arm my body with the best possible supplements to help it out.

You are speaking about things you don’t know. My husband is a first responder. He is a firefighter emt. So he is at a higher risk of exposure. As is the rest of our family. There are already 25 firefighters under quarantine a little over an hour from us, we are prepared the the likely possibility of quarantine. The masks DO provide protection and they limit spread as well. It’s idiotic to believe that they aren’t helpful for us but the medical professionals need them. We are perfectly capable of using a mask if and when appropriate and completing a fit test in addition as is done with the fire department. I personally don’t plan to be out and about, as I am a homeschooling stay at home mom- but if/ when shit hits the fan if have to go out I will use a mask. In addition, if a member of the family is sick, they will get a mask to contain any droplets etc. We aren’t hoarding masks, we bought two 10 packs for our family of 6. We aren’t stockpiling medical supplies, we do have pulse oximeters to check the oxygenation in the blood of any of us get sick. It is for peace of mind to be reassured that we don’t need to go to a medical facility because that is the last place I want to be with my family on a regular day, let alone now. We also have a blood pressure cuff, stethoscope, and an otoscope (which I regularly use to rule out ear infections. Besides that We are stocked with our normal supplements to support our immune systems. In general, I believe people are far too reliant on the government and run to a hospital for every little thing when we are perfectly capable of educating ourselves and caring for our families in these ways.

But wait, there's more! A Nobel laureate who helped discover HIV says that good hygiene, healthy living, and building a strong immune system through nutrition and supplements like vitamin C can not only prevent viral infections like HIV but can even rid your body of HIV.
Which would also pertain to corona virus. Who promotes this approach of healing the body tlrather than attacking the disease with harmful drugs? Holistic doctors, so many of whom have died mysteriously since 2015 that there is another conspiracy theory just regarding them.
Just some interesting related fluff, if you saw the biopic Dallas Buyers Club, his character became a hero after finding an Aids-curing clinic in Mexico where the focus was on holistic treatment and rebuilding ravaged immune systems. He railed against the toxic, expensive treatments that damaged the body.
The reason I mention this is that corona virus victims are getting treatments so toxic that it damages the heart muscles. When they are reinfected their treatment-damaged heart can go into arrest, thus the people in China dropping dead in the streets.
Not anti-drug or whatever, just found it interesting in the context of all the other coincidences:)

The claim is only an indication, we do not know for sure, hence the term “may” in the title.
In my opinion: Its not anti inflammatory drugs that makes it worse, its the aspecifieke immunosuppressive substances. All immunosuppressive substances are anti inflammatory, but not all anti inflammatory agents are immunosuppresors. Immune suppressive substances tend to reduce a whole scala of immune reactions by tuning it down. For supplements anti inflammatory substances can be both, though most are based on antioxidant reactions and cox2 Or pge inhibitors.
Unfortunately we do not know a lot of all activities performed by supplements, mostly they have been studied using simpel cell models and if the have been studied in clinical trial, the analysis is often focussed. We do know that the effects observed from many natural supplements are much shorter lived than clinical drugs, either lower bioavailability, shorter half life, or promiscuous effect. Personally I tend to say it is Okee to take them, however in normal amounts. But I have to say, I am not a docter.

People tend to spend little to no time in direct sunlight, which helps your body naturally generate vitamin D. Unless you take supplements, your immune system has less vitamin D with which to work and is thus weaker. I don't think that has an impact at all. For example, in Canada, vitamin D is added to our milk (required by law), yet there isn't a noticable difference between our seasonal flu rates than other western countries.

NAC also might increase BBB permeability according to some studies. It could help, it could just as well increase the risk of the virus infecting the CNS as could happen in as much as 30% of severely sick patients according to some Chinese data. I would be very conservative with supplements in this early stage with such poor data. Most important for boosting the immune system is probably sleep, reducing stress and a healthy diet. Supplements, especially antioxidants since oxidative stress and/or inflammation plays a part of the immune system response, most likely will not make any difference, or might even make things worse.

it would have to be for treatment administered early in the course of infections, when there are fewer complications like secondary bacterial infections, and when mere inhibition of viruses is enough to beat the infection.
How early? In China they prescribe cq alone for patients developing mild pneumonia to more severe respiratory symptoms. But not for patients who are already critical or older than 65. So yeah their thesis is to use cq to inhibit viral growth (sometimes with a dosis of zinc supplement?) So that patient immune system can then neutralize the infection on its own. Plus cq helps inhibit cytokine storm in some younger patients. They don't prescribe cq for more critical patients because by then the viral load in their system is already too much, per your point.
Judging from this study it seems that they are using the hcq+ azt combo to treat patients in critical stage/ICU and older patients including that 85 years old. So this is consistent with your point.

""There's no evidence that supplements help in this context at all, and when they are making a claim like that … I think it's really problematic. And I hope regulators take a look at it.""
OK — what was the claim again?
""Boost your immune system! We have formulated a supplement to help prevent, and hopefully help treat the virus,"" the email, which was sent to patients on Friday, reads. ""Little is known about the treatment of this virus, but there are various agents showing promising results.""
It's likely true there is evidence for various supplements demonstrating some level of antiviral activity against other coronaviruses. Here's one . Why don't you think patients should not be entitled to know about this or act on it?
None of this is to say that particular naturopath clinic necessarily has any credibility, or even gathered supporting evidence before making the claim. But that's an argument for local family doctors to report the bad actors, and perhaps a case for stricter licensing. It's not a reason to eliminate a role that is key to facilitating patients making their own proactive decisions, on top of their doctors advice.

I went on vacation this past weekend (1/29-1/31) with a close friend. She flew to SoCal from 1/23-1/24 to visit her family. When she landed in Vegas, she complained about her chest hurting. She also had headaches and kept complaining about how tired she was.
I got back on Sunday night (1/31). She texts me on 2/3 to say that a close family member was rushed to the hospital on Sunday and was diagnosed with covid. She was tested too. Her results came back positive. So that means that she caught it during her SoCal trip from 1/23-1/24 and had it during our trip. I don’t have any symptoms. I have been taking supplements for a year to build up my immune system...quercetin, NAC, vitamin c, vitamin d, and zinc. I doubled up on my dosages when i got back just in case. It is now day 6 after returning from our trip. I feel fine and don’t have any symptoms. I still have my taste and smell, there’s no sneezing or coughing, no headaches, fatigue, fever, headaches, chest pain, etc. Is it possible that she didn’t pass it to me? I’ve self quarantined and am considering taking a test if i don’t show any symptoms by day 10.

""the only thing that truly matters is our own individual perspective(read experience)"" the same way each capable adult is responsible for the health of their own body? And my health is NOT someone else's responsibility? I choose to not smoke, while others choose to. They choose to put harmful smoke into their lungs. They also harm others with secondhand smoke, I still don't get why no smoker has been charged with manslaughter or some form of killing someone else...because it can't be proven? But we know it happens.
I choose whether or not to eat junk food, or take nutritional supplements, or get enough sleep. These all have effects on a person's immune system. And as a physically and mentally capable adult, those are my decisions for my own body, because I am responsible for my health.
Don't tell me I'm responsible for someone else's health when I don't control their immune system strength. I can't make them take supplements, etc, but that is what anyone says that claims ""everyone as a group is responsible for everyone else's health"".

1267,2021-02-15 19:00:00,To All the Colleges I've Loved Before,"
Dear Harvard,
First of all, I refused to apply to your restrictive-early action. You think you're so amazing, restricting students to apply early to other places all of a sudden. Just so you know, I rather simp for Yale; at least their AOs had actually read most of their early applications.
Did you know that when you send me emails, I would come to love you? Sometimes I think yes. Definitely yes. You know why? Because you think EVERYONE loves you, Harvard. That's what I love about you. Because everyone does love you. Including me. I do. Always and forever. Here are all your best qualities:
You stick “Veritas” up on your logo. You just assume everyone else will find it charming on your crimson-colored sweatshirts. Frankly, it makes you seem sophisticated, and maybe you are.
You have the most famous professors. You’re ranked #16 for computer science, but the first 15 colleges don’t have David Malan and CS50. They ain’t got Michael Sandel and Gary King and Steven Pinker. Your professors are good at everything. Too good. You have given other colleges a chance to be good, but they never took the opportunity.
You sent me commercial emails for no reason. You know I didn’t win a science Nobel Prize or throw a football 100 yards or cure cancer, but you still did it. Just because you could. I really want to know: Why would you do that to me? My inbox was supposed to be something special. I've seen college reaction videos, what it's supposed to feel like — sudden adrenaline rush upon receiving a college email notification. Maybe you’ll send me a likely letter instead?
I never even thought about you before. Harvard Alumni always said that you are the best school in the world, and I agreed, because sure, you are. But I still didn't see the allure of you. Plenty of colleges are prestigious. That doesn't make them interesting or intriguing or cool. Maybe that’s why you hypnotized my parents to keep telling me that you are the best? To mind control me, to make me see you that way. It worked. Your little trick worked.
Do you know what it's like to like a college so much you can't stand it and know that they'll never feel the same way? Probably not. Organizations like you don't have to suffer through those kinds of things. It was easier after my school’s REA applicants post their acceptances on ig stories. I’m happy for them; I really am. At least then I didn't have to hear about it.
And now that the application season is over, I know for sure that I am also over you. I'm immune to you now, Harvard. Now I know I have crappy supplemental essays, I never ever have to worry about catching you again. What a relief! I bet if I did ever open your email again, I would definitely spend $70 on something, and it wouldn't be for a Harvard application. It would be a “Harvard sucks” mug they sell at the Yale gift shop!

​
Dear Yale,
I liked you first. You’re like a woke Harvard who everyone apparently loves more. Your school logo is constantly asking us “why,” and I dig that. I’m wondering the same thing. Although you can’t beat Harvard at football games, your status update page beats Harvard any time of the day. It’s so clean, efficient, and it actually shows a checklist of financial aid documents.
If we’re meant to be together, I'd have packed my suitcase. I would have never left you. Not until I graduate, that is. I like your buildings but Ion wanna live in New Haven; besides having good pizzas, it’s probably depressing asf with its six months of snowstorms every year.
P.S. Don’t take that personally. I still love you, Yale.

​
Dear USC,
I know the exact day it all started. Fall, eighth grade. I get caught in the rain and rain sucks. I don’t understand how other Washingtonians don’t mind getting their hair and sleeves wet.
It was right then. That's when I knew, all the way down to my soaking-wet Hollister t-shirt from which one could see the shape of my abs. I want to move to LA, University of Southern California. I really love you. I might have only heard your name after your admission scandal, and I don’t have money to bribe the rowing coach or donate a building, but I think that you might love me back. I'm not a trojan or anything, but perhaps I don’t mind getting named after a condom brand.
USC Merit scholarship. I loved the sound of that. One day, I bet the people you give full-rides to will be with you. They’re really fortunate. Maybe you already have decided. If you do, know this—I can’t afford your school without a full-ride because I’m broke as hell.
Good-bye, USC.

Dear Stanford,
I never met a college as perfect as yours. You ought to have the chillest yet hardest-working student body, the biggest campus of them all, and endless silicon valley opportunities. I wish I knew what kind of applicants you liked. As far as I can tell, you haven't accepted anyone and your acceptance rate is lower than our GPAs… Unless you don’t actually exist and this whole application thing is a scam? You're just so mysterious. The things I wrote about in my essays are so unsubstantial, so unsatisfying, like that you don’t even post your detailed admission stats on your website. I guess the one remotely real thing I know about you is you want us to write to our future roommates, which must mean you are hinting that I will have a roommate at Stanford?? I wish you send me a likely-letter already. I hope you would.
I think you're very special. I think you are probably one of the most special schools out there. Or maybe I don't, because with a sub-1% acceptance rate I might as well apply to Hamburger University.
Love,
u/milkteadj
​
Dear MIT,
I’ve never seen you and probably never will because we live so far apart and you only accept Tony Stark type of guys. Remember in my interview with you, your MD interviewer told me that MIT is going to be harder than medical school? hehe
I was really bored in the first week of January after turning in all my common apps. My boredom and your Jan 6th deadline are why I applied to you, MIT. So, thank you for satisfying my Stockholm syndrome developed from college applications. Also, you have good vibes. I wish you give me a chance to be an “MIT-certified engineer” like Howard from the Big Bang Theory. Perhaps I’ll wash dishes with Elon Musk in a soup kitchen someday. Take care, MIT. Have a really good rest of 2021 and a really good life.

"
1268,2021-02-05 05:30:00,Just a PSA for everyone,"
I don't entirely disagree with you, but I will highlight this:
What does that mean: boost the immune system? Most people apparently think that the immune system is like a muscle, and by working it, giving it supplements and vitamins, the immune system will become stronger. Bigger. More impressive, bulging like Mr. Universe’s bicep. That’s the body part I am thinking about. What they are boosting is vague, on par with chi/qi or innate intelligence. They never really say what is being boosted.
The immune system, if you are otherwise healthy, cannot be boosted, and doing those things you learned in kindergarten health (reasonable diet, exercise and sleep), will provide the immune system all the boosting or support it needs.
Someone is going to write in and say Americans have a lousy diet and don’t exercise and can benefit from better food and exercise. And that’s true. If you are not taking care of yourself, your immune function can be improved to function better. But if you are at your optimal baseline, you cannot make your immune function better.
So when something allegedly boosts the immune system, I have to ask what part. How? What is it strengthening/boosting/supporting? Antibodies? Complement? White cells? Are the results from test tubes (often meaningless), animal studies, or human studies? And if in human studies, what was the study population? Are the results even meaningful? Or small, barely statistically significant, outcomes in poorly-done studies?

How is your diet? Your gut is the center of your immune system and can help to reduce inflammation. Consider looking into an anti inflammatory diet or the autoimmune protocol which will help your body heal itself. https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/aip-diet-autoimmune-protocol-diet
The supplement l-lysine may also help. It works as well or better for coldsores compared to anti viral pills. Both conditions are part of the larger herpes simplex class of viruses, much like chicken pox and shingles. Its worth a shot.

Yep absolutely agree with other post - go and see a doctor would be the first point of action. For me I am ONLY having acne as a response so I'm not too worried about it being a sign of a more serious issue (PCOS). First of all I stopped using actives which seems to be really helpful and just concentrating on hydration. Also doing an extremely mild liver cleanse and adding immune support + zinc as supplements to make sure it's not coming from that basis. I've worked with my GP and an osteo/naturopath and it's only the start; I've personally already seen improvement! But that being said; GP is always the best place to start.

For almost a year now, we've been given the same advice from our government. Stay home, wear a mask, socially distance from others etc. But I have a huge issue with whats NOT being said, and that is, promoting healthy lifestyles. What I mean by this is our government is not reminding the public to eat healthy, exercise and take the proper supplements to improve the immune system. Instead, we're told to just wait for a vaccine and that's it. Truly, I think this is disgusting, because I know if people were reminded on a daily basis to eat right, exercise and take the proper supplements, more people would not only be alive today, but peoples overall health and well being would be greatly improved. Now obviously, if you tell someone to eat healthier, exercise etc, a percentage will just ignore it, and that's fine, you can't force people to do things they don't wanna do. However I truly believe the people of this province need to be reminded to practice healthy habits, and it really pisses me off that this isn't being talked about. It's frustrating because besides Reddit, I feel like I can't get my voice out to the entire population. Please people, try to improve your eating/exercise habits. It will improve your immune system and well being.
On the topic of supplements, there is another whole issue that isn't being talked about, and that is vitamin D3 deficiency. If you're like me and you're listening to stay at home orders, chances are, you're probably not getting enough D3 (sunlight) Please people, do your research and take a D3 supplement. There are a list of issues that are caused by being deficient in this vitamin, which include but are not limited to; Lower testosterone in men, mental health issues including depression and anxiety, muscle fatigue, weakened immune system and so on. Please everyone, if you don't think you're getting enough sunlight, you probably aren't, and should strongly consider a D3 supplement. I personally like the oral drops because they're potent, cheap, and means you don't need to swallow a capsule/caplet.
For the people who took their time to read this, I strongly appreciate it. I care about the people in this province and the people around me. Please, please, take care of yourselves. Thank you for reading this.
PS: I'll also add if you are having suicidal thoughts (can't lie I've had them recently) please talk to a friend, a family member, or phone a hotline for support. There is hope! 833-456-4566 is the suicide hotline.
TLDR: Government isn't promoting healthy habits. Eat healthy, exercise and supplement properly to improve your immune system and well being so if you do happen to get COVID, you'll be more likely to fight it off. Take care of yourselves.

1284,2021-02-14 15:16:00,Why are fats in a diet important? What does the body use fat for?,"
The cell membrane is made out of a phospholipid bilayer. A phospholipid molecule is a fatty acid molecule bound to a phosphate ion. Fats are also used for hormones, absorption transport of substances/nutrients, nerve sheaths, and probably lots of other things I can’t think of. Also, your body stores fat in strategic areas for protection of more delicate structures, such as cushioning between the eyeball and the skull. Different types of fats are used for different things.
One thing most people don’t think of - fats are the starting point for inflammatory cascades. When tissue is injured or foreign microbes are detected, a cascade of signaling molecules starts, and soon inflammatory cells are recruited to the area. That all starts by cleavage of a lipid from the phospholipid bilayer, and it’s called the arachodonic cascade. NSAIDs actually work to stop a specific enzymatic function of this cascade, and altering the types of fatty acids that comprise your diet can alter how strongly your immune system reacts. This is the reasoning behind joint supplements and why they contain what they contain.

Asthma: Randomized trials examining the effect of vitamin D supplementation on asthma outcomes are inconclusive.
Tuberculosis: vitamin D supplementation does not appear to improve clinical outcomes in patients with active TB nor prevent TB infection in children with vitamin D deficiency
Hypertension: Overall, there does not appear to be a beneficial clinical effect of vitamin D supplementation on blood pressure
Cardiovascular Disease: Although low serum 25(OH)D levels have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in some studies, there is no evidence that vitamin D supplementation improves cardiovascular outcomes.

It's irresponsible to say that when studies thus far are inconclusive. The big problem is when people feel they don't need to go to the doctor because they're ""doing something"" already.
If someone will benefit from taking supplements then their doctor will tell them so. Some rando on the internet isn't going to give some kind of groundbreaking advice that a doctor won't.

Immunity from vaccines will be supplemented by immunity from endemic infection, and sterilising vaccination isn’t a requirement in safeguarding the community nor something we should even particularly expect.
None of this should “scare the shit” out of you. We have extremely effective tools against disease turned around in short order without compromising safety. We even have potential backups and boosters for those tools today with more in the pipeline.
Step back from the expectation for zero cases of infection and look at what these tools are doing for management of the disease.

Vitamin D supplementation seems to be a great way to boost your immune system. However, the link between COVID and vitamin D still may not be as strong as it appears. About 7/10 Americans are vitamin d deficient right off the bat. So 9/10 patients is about a 20% increase in chances??

Yeah i am still bewildered to this day about all the myths i hear about Vitamin D. It seems that a majority of people believe it improves depression and energy and somehow ""boosts"" the immune system, though what exactly ""boosts"" means is not clear to me (surely exercise and sleep ""boost"" the immune system more than a dietary supplement?). I even remember when the USPSTF recommended Vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in the elderly, but subsequently discovered that that wasn't actually true and removed the recommendation. And i saw a study published in JAMA at some point about Vitamin D supplementation potentially reducing breathing problems in preterm black babies, but the results were that it actually made no difference. Obviously we need Vitamin D and not seeing kids with rickets anymore is awesome, but it seems to be constantly touted as some kind of miracle cure without any evidence.

1300,2021-03-06 03:16:00,How should I spend my last hours or days before the symptoms get bad?,"
Here is what I would do if it were me. (Not medical advice, just a summary of what I would do, and did when sick)
Take vitamin D3, 5000 IU every 8 hours for 4 days, then twice a day for 10 days. Then just 5000 IU once a day.. (unless you are already taking at least 2000 IU of vitamin D3, then just take 5000 IU daily). Having adequate vitamin D lessens the risk of severe covid, and you can do this without prescription. This sharpens your immune system to be able to slow the virus.
Also start vitamin C 1000 mg tablets several times a day. My dose was 5000 mg every 8 hours..
Zinc 40-50 mg twice a day plus Quercetin 400-500 mg twice a day as a zinc ionophore may help slow the virus.
Elderberry-zinc gummies several time a day to reduce the virus in your mouth and throat.
If you can get a prescription for ivermectin, I'd be taking that as well. Take with food to increase absorption (the opposite of the instructions when you take to treat an intestinal parasite).

1301,2021-03-23 18:51:00,Weekly Questions Thread 20/03/2021,"Is there anyone willing to make this mod with me?
Grimwar's Challenge
It includes a bunch of new items, like craftable spears and boomerangs among other things, and an overhaul of the damage and defense systems of various monsters. I'll show you sokme of the designs.
The damage systems are altered, in base Teraria, the damage tables are all the same, melee, magic, ranged and summon are all included as a single type of ""damage,"" damage. But what if I altered it around some, and made certain weapons in Terraria more than a matter of personal choice, and gave all of them some actual utility? I'd start by giving the mosnters increased and decreased defenses against these new damage types, which all fall under four families depending on the weapon type. Note that the subtype damages are the same across all classes, but called different names to ensure their distinction.
ELEMENTAL
Note: The elemental class of damage would be unique in that it would exist purely as a supplement to all other damage types.
Fire: The increased damage by turning maces into flaming maces, or making flamarangs, is often accredited to this, this damage type includes frostfire. As an elemental damage type, certain enemies are weak to fire, like Demon Eyes (including Eye of Cthulhu), slimes, all insects, plants, birds, fish, and undead are weak to this, creatures native to the Underworld and stone enemies like Golems and Granite Elementals are immune.
Water: This would be supplemental to things like the water bolt, and any other weapons that use water this mod would incorporate: Skeletons and zombies, the denizens of the underworld, natives of the ice biome with the exception of the Ice Golem, Ice Elemental, Icy Merman, and Sand Elementals are weak to this, while denizens of the oceans or already water going creatures will have a hard time feeling the effects.
Lightning: This would be used by weapons like the Thunder Zapper, or other electicity based weapons, obviously. Birds would be weak to this, and creatures of the water would be very weak to this, and enemies made of stone or non-conductive materials would be immune to this.
Ice: Ice boomerangs and Armaroks and the like, I think it'd be easy to se where this one is gonig, strong agaisnt zombies and non-Tundra fish, really strong against underworld, and jungle.
Life: This would encapsulate the damage bonuses granted by poison, such as the flask of poison, posion darts, Blade of Grass, Chlorophyte bullets, and weapons and attacks native to the Jungle. Anything native to the mushroom biome and corruption gets trashed by this damage type, the undead are stronger against this.
Viral: The damage inflicted by weapons of the mushroom biome, like the Shroomerang, Mushroom Spear, or Hammush. This is a nightmare for denizens of the Jungle, even moreso than Jungle is for the mushroom, and it wreaks havoc against The Crimson.
Evil: This is the damage type of things like ichor, and cursed flames, and many hard mode Evil Biome Weapons, most things that are not of the underworld or not undead are weak to this, Hallowed enemies are somewhat weak against this, and evil biome enemies and wasps are immune against this.
Dark: Evil biome damage but not necessarily evil, Shadowflame, demon magic weapons, and items crafted with demonite/crimtane ore without souls of night count within this, it's not as devastating against Hallowed beings, but Evil Biome creatures have no resistance to this damage type.
Fey: The default damage type for weapons made in China (I mean, The Hallow!), Evil Biome creatures are weak against this, and Underworld denizens the same amount.
Light: One of the more interesting ones, this damage type comes from weapons that use Hallowed Bars, which will be expanded greatly in this mod, the Mechanical Bosses will drop more Hallowed Bars, the items that use them in their construction will use less in their construction, but to maintain balance will require greater quantities of other materials (that are not acquired from The Mechanical Bosses) in their construction. There will also be an option eventually to be able to make purified versions of the Fey weapons with a special crafting station. Underworld creatures don't suffer as much from this as they do Fey damage, but Evil Biome enemies are devastated by this (including all wasps)
MELEE
Peirce: Short swords and pickaxes, zombies are somewhat strong against this, and skeletons even moreso, but the effect of this on small things like piranhas, Demon Eyes, Snow Flinxes, are devastating, bigger creatures like demons, derplings, larger slimes, are actually strong against this.
Cut/Chop: regular swords, axes, This type of damage is perfect for skeletons, zombies, and giant underground insects, weaker against bats, salamanders, and slimes
Grind: This is the category of damage the yoyos inflict, small creatures and anything that can logically feel and be hindered by pain, or are vulnerable to having small bits of them being ground off, like worms, fish, skeletons, bats, slimes, are weak against this, things like Flesh Monsters, insects like the antlions, the tortoises, are strong against this.
Bludgeon: Now we're getting to the good stuff, hammers, flails, and boulders. Small creatures like bats, all insects, all skeletons, all birds, Tortoises, and Meteor Heads are devastated by this, including the granite enemies, who are strong against all previous damage types.
Saw: The tsundere love child between Pierce and Cut damage, infliccted by drills and saws. They have the strengths of both and eschew most of the weaknesses of both, with the exception of being weak against smaller creatures with supposedly high evasion like bats.
Impale: The Spears and dungeon spikes, the weakness of Peirce against bigger enemies is removed and actually replaced with a bonus against them, though naturally skeletons and turtles are still strong against this.
RANGED
Stuck: Equivalent to pierce, arrows and harpoons
Shot: anything with bullets
Savage: Any Bow that shoots creatures and bubbles instead of arrows, and the 'artillery' bows like the Blood Rainbow, and Deadalus Stormbow apply
Concussive: Equivalent to bludgeon, anything that uses explosions or concussive force
Burn: Unique to the flamethrowers
MAGIC
Drill: Equivalent to pierce and stuck, for things like the waterbolt, or
Assault: Equivalent to Savage, anything that uses weather or living things, like the Crimson Rod, Bee Gun, or Vilethorn
Stone: Equivalent to Bludgeon and Concussive, Magic Harps and Magic Missiles
I haven't figured the magic damage list yet, and haven't evens tarted on the SUMMON category, but I think you get the idea by now.
The biggest things I'd need help with to make this a reality would be spriters and coders, I have a pretty good idea of how this would function, but since I'm inexperienced with this kind of stuff, I'm also unsure of how to properly balance this. This would also add enemies for the forest and corruption."

The little research that has been done on it confirms exactly what the prophet (pbuh) said. Studies show that an extract of Nigleria Fowleri has anti-biotic properties, anti-diabetic properties, boosts the immune system, and has anti-tumor properties that are so tantalizing that it is being developed by some British firm as a possible therapy for lung cancer. Interestingly the studies show that it doesnt decrease mortality in cancer but does decrease incidences of remission and does decrease tumor size...""everything but death..."".
Now, for example the anti-microbial properties of N. fowleri have been shown to be weaker than the anti-microbial properties of antibiotics like gentamicin. But thats ok, cause gentamycin doesnt have anti-diabetic properties, anti-tumor properties, etc like N. fowleri. The extract also has no negative known side effects, which no anti-biotic can claim. As a budding physician, I would recommend using N. Fowleri extract as a general daily nutritional supplement to strengthen your immune system, and using the appropriate antibiotics if you have an infection.
Remember the Prophet S.a.W, said ""IN the black seed.."", therefore it is an extract of the black seed that we should look at, not just consuming the whole seed and thinking it will work."

My mom got COVID Dec 4 2020. 62 yo, T2 Diabetic, blood type O-, overweight, 29 bmi, angina, atherosclerosis, copd. Even scarier, in late 2019 she got pneumonia and it caused a heart attack. Fortunately she was already feeling crappy and was in the hospital being monitored when heart attack happened, so she survived (she stopped breathing and was intubated right away, saving her life).
She should have got wrecked. Bad. But not really, she was sick for 4 weeks. Her symptoms were debilitating headaches, fatigue, slight shortness of breath (SOB) at night, muscle pain, and dry smoker's cough. She never got a fever and her SOB never got too bad (she has experience here with her pneumonia). Never went to the doctor. Took tylenol and immune system supplements w/vitamin d, c, zinc starting a week after diagnosis.
A month after recovery, she had a mild heart attack that doctors believe is unrelated to COVID. Can't be sure though. She did have a blood transfusion since she had about half the blood in her body of a normal person. It is believed to be a genetic condition though since tests show no bleeding anywhere in her body AND two of her sisters also have experienced this with both getting blood transfusions. Low blood could be the cause of heart attack.
She felt great after blood transfusion, but is back to experiencing fatigue again. Doctors are scheduled to run more tests in future to see what's wrong.

Keep yourself as healthy as possible: diet and exercise. Abreva, Lysine, and Rx antivirals (contact doc) are your friends. If you smoke, quit. Stay away from supplements containing arginine, including many pre-workout supps.
Your immune system may get a handle on the virus so you no longer have outbreaks nor are able to spread it (subclinical). Did you know that you still have every virus you have ever had still in your system? Your immune system just gets a handle over the effects.

1313,2019-12-30 15:29:00,Strategies to convince mother with cancer not to seek TCM treatment? : skeptic,"
My mother has stage 4 breast cancer that's been kept fairly stable with standard western medicine for a few years now, and she's part of some sort of study with a University, with more than the standard follow ups.
A few weeks ago, a friend of hers recommended a Traditional Chinese Medicine holistic clinic after said friend's son had positive results. The son suffers from headaches and anxiety most likely related to him playing football in high school. Now, she wants to go see this clinic, about 700km away from where she lives, and the ""treatment"" would cost between 2 and 5k CAD a month. My parents don't have that money, and I'm very weary of it being a scam. Usually I don't get mixed up when she does these alternative medicine things because even if it's placebo, it's fine.
She also asked my opinion, and I told her, but she isn't changing her mind, so I'm thinking of another strategy where it's not as contrarian, to sort of make her come to the conclusion herself, or at least scare her (see later). Her reasons for wanting the treatment are that she wants to try everything possible to keep the cancer under control. To me, this is seems like a classic ""fear of missing out"" reaction mixed with desperation.
I did some basic research about the clinic, and it turns out the owner was recently accused for sexual assault and is on trial. I told her and my dad about this, and their response was that it was all a hoax, the women were lying and just bringing down someone who was doing good (keep in mind they know nothing about this case other than a word-of-mouth recommendation). They also presented a few examples of people who were wrongfully accused. My reply was to first ""agree"", that my stance was innocent until proven guilty, but that these were serious allegations, and the courts would decide (they'd probably disagree with the courts). I also asked them how they'd react if their daughter was in these women's shoes and she wasn't lying, they didn't reply. Anyways, it seems that the previous owner isn't practicing anymore and the assaults were done as part of the ""fertility treatment"", so I'm not worried about that.
I'm pretty sure that arguing against the basis of TCM won't convince her. I will agree with her on the basic holistic approach, but that that approach can also be found in current western medicine. I have read up a bit on the stance of the Canadian Cancer Society, and there are a few additional things that I think might help turn her around, most notably that some of the concoctions and teas might have adverse effects/contradictions, and that there were traces of actual medications found in the supplements given (not to mention the possibility of heavy metal contamination). She is lucky to be in a very strict study, not pay for it, so anything extra that can be found in her blood work puts her at a risk, not only in terms of health, but complicating her relationship with the medical team (ie. maybe she'll get kicked out and have to pay for stuff she's getting for free now).
So, my strategy is to get her on the phone when my dad isn't around, first agree with the premise of holistic and some alternative medicines (for example, I have researched some mushroom supplements to boost her immune system), but that in this case, the risks are too great because of non-regulated substances. TCM itself is regulated in that province, but I think only in terms of training and whatnot. I don't know if I should mention that traveling 700km by car and paying who knows how much for herbal teas and acupuncture is not a good investment.
Does anyone have other ideas how to go about this?

Age + Partner's age (if relevant): I am 32 and my husband is 36
Typical cycle length: My cycles were around 28 days.
Ovulation cycle day: CD14 temp rise, with positive opks on CD 12-13, and fertile CM from CD 9-15.
CD/DPO of positive test(s): I was #teamnotest, so I took a hot the day after Christmas on 13DPO / CD27 when my period was dueled had a clear positive on a pregmate cheapie.
Tracking methods and app(s) used: Fertility Friend paid subscription...it is the best!
Relevant days of sperminating and/or method (SMEP, TI, IUI, FET, etc.): We hit O-4, O-3, O-1, O, O+1. We we’re seeing a RE, so he had us on TI similar to the SMEP method. Recommended every other day starting CD10 and bumping it up to every day through the day after ovulation using opks.
Health conditions/medical tests: We has started seeing a RE, so I had CD3 and CD21 bloodwork including AMH of 1.66, a transvaginal ultrasound to check structure and AFC with great follicle count contradicting my AMH. I was supposed to go at the beginning of the new year for a HSG. DH had a semen analysis with normal results. Mainly, I have a very rare autoimmune disease called Neuro-Behcets, and severe migraines.
Supplements and medications (yours and/or your partner’s): Our RE prescribed 25mg clomid CD3-7 (second round) for unexplained infertility, and I started taking CoQ10 on CD1 for the first time because I suspected egg quality may have been a factor since DH’s. SA was great. I was on prenatal vitamins, folic acid, 0.5mg clonazepam, and 150mg azathioprene (immunosuppressant). I also had fioricet and Relpax for migraines and zofran for nausea. I did not use these the past two months because i was desperate to eliminate every med I could, even if a high risk dr we met with said they were ok. I was also on and off high dose naproxen and had some prednisone at thee beginning of November due to repeat scleritis flares (vision threatening eye inflammation due to the NBD). I smoked medical marijuana and my husband, recreational. This did not affect his count.
Birth control history (if relevant): I was on hormonal bcp’s pretty much continuously since I was 14-15 years olds (approximately 16 years!)

Symptom spotting: We were spending Christmas on an island with no stores and only golf carts for Christmas, so brought testing supplies and period supplies because I was due for my period by the 26th. My mantra the entire tww was “its all thee progesterone” because last month I symptom spotted hard on my first clomid round and was so disappointed when my period arrived. I suspected by Christmas that I might be pregnant, but decided Christmas I didn’t want to ruin it being so sad if I was wrong since I had been wrong and had a year of negatives. I just couldn’t do it and decided I’d test the morning after Christmas, the day my period was due, if my temp was still up. I felt low level queasiness and was starving all the time, even waking me up from sleep starting at 10DPO, the 23rd. I had a temp drop at 10DPO that I had never seen in many months of temping followed by an immediate rise the next day that was suspicious. By 11DPO I realized my nose was super sensitive when DH put his feet on me watching Christmas movies and I gagged because his socks stunk so bad. Right before Christmas my husband gave me a hug and pulled away saying he was too hot and I was a furnace. This was strange, because I always run cold. I also had super hard nipples for like half the day each day and one sided (at a time) extreme feelings like someone was pinching or twisting my nipples. My breasts felt heavy by Xmas eve and were much more full in the top half. Everything I felt before my BFP was very very subtle and could easily be explained away.
Other (advice/tip(s), freaking out, miscellaneous): . I was totally in shock when I got my BFP. I kept checking the one test I took, afraid the line would disappear! I had very limited cheapie tests that I had brought since there were no stores on the tiny island unless you went over to mainland FL but was glad I wasn’t too much of a pessimist to bring those ones! I am glad I was #teamnotest because not testing before the day my period was due was a lot more emotionally healthy for me. I am also SO thankful we saw a RE because I truly believe the clomid was our miracle. I clearly did NOT have PCOS, but assume I must have had some more minor ovulation problem despite showing nice temp rises at ovulation or luteal phase issue. I’ll be interested to hear what my RE thinks. We are hoping for an uneventful 9 months and I am reminding myself each day that today I am pregnant. TFAB has been an amazing community and I have been so lucky to have you guys!
Also...”Don’t stress” is totally bullshit. I ate what I wanted, I drank up until my positive pregnancy test without care, we were getting ready to book a flight to Australia in April when we got home after Christmas, and we had a very stressful month, as well as a flight before I even knew I was pregnant, but likely already had implanted. I will repeat again, drink til it’s pink and don’t deprive yourself of things, stress is NOT preventing you from conceiving. It’s total bullshit. My body went through so much mentally and physically this month and this was THE BFP month!

Your eyes your ears your mouth your nose and any cuts you have open to the air are a portal of energy for any viral or bacterial vector to enter your body and make you sick.
Best to keep it covered and keep moving .
Someone coughing doesn’t even mean the sickness is spreading, generally that’s the recovery stage. Because the body is working harder to fight off the illness and you are seeing the symptoms of the body fighting illness as sickness. ( runny nose, headache, drowsy )
Most of the time the infectious stage is undetectable unless tests are done.
Best to keep warm ( conserve what your body has to do to keep you alive, saves work in producing heat to reallocate resources to other areas I.e fighting illness which it does all the time )
And sleep regular hours eat well exercise and supplement your diet !
Magnesium zinc these are great for boasting immunity because these salts are necessary for creating any type of white blood phage/cell.
And eating more damn vegetables not canned, fresh vegetables and preferably raw ( clean them first and be sure you can eat them raw first some veggies can’t be eaten raw like potatoes real bad idea to do it like really bad ) or lightly steamed and cooked . The enzymes that are present in veggies have been a part of our diet since like forever or at least long enough for our body to recognize and use them to help fight off any infections

Cancer patients commonly use dietary supplements to “boost immune function”. A polysaccharide extract from Grifola frondosa (Maitake extract) showed immunomodulatory effects in preclinical studies and therefore the potential for clinical use.
In a phase I/II dose escalation trial, 34 postmenopausal breast cancer patients, free of disease after initial treatment, were enrolled sequentially in five cohorts. Maitake liquid extract was taken orally at 0.1, 0.5, 1.5, 3, or 5 mg/kg twice daily for 3 weeks. Peripheral blood was collected at days −7, 0 (prior to the first dosing), 7, 14, and 21 for ex vivo analyses. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability.
No dose-limiting toxicity was encountered. Two patients withdrew prior to completion of the study due to grade I possibly related side effects: nausea and joint swelling in one patient; rash and pruritus in the second. There was a statistically significant association between Maitake and immunologic function ( p < 0.0005). Increasing doses of Maitake increased some immunologic parameters and depressed others; the dose–response curves for many endpoints were non-monotonic with intermediate doses having either immune enhancing or immune suppressant effects compared with both hig and low doses.
Oral administration of a polysaccharide extract from Maitake mushroom is associated with both immunologically stimulatory and inhibitory measurable effects in peripheral blood. Cancer patients should be made aware of the fact that botanical agents produce more complex effects than assumed, and may depress as well as enhance immune function.

Hericium erinaceus (Bull.) Pers. is a medicinal mushroom capable of inducing a large number of modulatory effects on human physiology ranging from the strengthening of the immune system to the improvement of cognitive functions. In mice, dietary supplementation with H. erinaceus prevents the impairment of spatial short-term and visual recognition memory in an Alzheimer model .
In wild-type mice the oral supplementation with H. erinaceus induces, in behaviour test, a significant improvement in the recognition memory and, in hippocampal slices, an increase in spontaneous and evoked excitatory synaptic current in mossy fiber-CA3 synapse. In conclusion, we have produced a series of findings in support of the concept that H. erinaceus induces a boost effect onto neuronal functions also in nonpathological conditions.

Correlation is not causation. Given that you want the presumption of scientific stat dumping, this is a ridiculous oversight given your extreme and unsupported claim.
Vitamin B12 - synthesis of red blood cells, DNA and healthy nervous system function.
Plants don't actually lack it, you'll pick it up from dirt on vegetables or roots of you eat a good diet. However, vegan doesn't mean you only eat plants: the B12 in animal products comes from bacteria, and that's directly where vegans get theirs.
Incidentally, omnivores should also supplement with B12.
Vitamin D3 - healthy immune system function, bone health

Vitamin A (retinol) - healthy vision, reproduction
Unnecessary to consume in active retinol form, you get plenty of the precursor from plants.
Vitamin K2 - blood clotting
It's not clear that anyone needs to eat this, but it's easily obtained from fermented foods.
Cholesterol - synthesis of cell membranes, hormones
Sterols are incredibly easy to consume and metabolize into cholesterol. Your body requires no help here.
Saturated fat
Easily obtained from many plant sources and not required in any significant amount.
Taurine - normal skeletal muscle function

1325,2019-12-22 19:34:00,"Big New Review Paper on Probiotics and Their Benefits for Athletes, Diet, Exercise, Hormones, Performance and more. - 21, December 2019","
International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: Probiotics
TL;DR Overall, the studies reviewed in this position statement provide modest evidence that probiotics can provide some clinical benefits in athletes and other highly active individuals - Table 3 .
Longer TL;DR Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host (FAO/WHO).
Probiotic administration has been linked to a multitude of health benefits, with gut and immune health being the most researched applications.
Despite the existence of shared, core mechanisms for probiotic function, health benefits of probiotics are strain- and dose-dependent.
Athletes have varying gut microbiota compositions that appear to reflect the activity level of the host in comparison to sedentary people, with the differences linked primarily to the volume of exercise and amount of protein consumption. Whether differences in gut microbiota composition affect probiotic efficacy is unknown.
The main function of the gut is to digest food and absorb nutrients. In athletic populations, certain probiotics strains can increase absorption of key nutrients such as amino acids from protein, and affect the pharmacology and physiological properties of multiple food components.
Immune depression in athletes worsens with excessive training load, psychological stress, disturbed sleep, and environmental extremes, all of which can contribute to an increased risk of respiratory tract infections. In certain situations, including exposure to crowds, foreign travel and poor hygiene at home, and training or competition venues, athletes’ exposure to pathogens may be elevated leading to increased rates of infections. Approximately 70% of the immune system is located in the gut and probiotic supplementation has been shown to promote a healthy immune response. In an athletic population, specific probiotic strains can reduce the number of episodes, severity and duration of upper respiratory tract infections.
Intense, prolonged exercise, especially in the heat, has been shown to increase gut permeability which potentially can result in systemic toxemia. Specific probiotic strains can improve the integrity of the gut-barrier function in athletes.
Administration of selected anti-inflammatory probiotic strains have been linked to improved recovery from muscle-damaging exercise.
The minimal effective dose and method of administration (potency per serving, single vs. split dose, delivery form) of a specific probiotic strain depends on validation studies for this particular strain. Products that contain probiotics must include the genus, species, and strain of each live microorganism on its label as well as the total estimated quantity of each probiotic strain at the end of the product’s shelf life, as measured by colony forming units (CFU) or live cells.
Preclinical and early human research has shown potential probiotic benefits relevant to an athletic population that include improved body composition and lean body mass, normalizing age-related declines in testosterone levels, reductions in cortisol levels indicating improved responses to a physical or mental stressor, reduction of exercise-induced lactate, and increased neurotransmitter synthesis, cognition and mood. However, these potential benefits require validation in more rigorous human studies and in an athletic population.
Key Points Key Points 1 – Role of diet and exercise on an athlete’s gut microbiome.
Active individuals appear to display a higher abundance of health-promoting bacterial species and increased microbiota diversity.
Body composition and physical activity are positively correlated with several bacterial populations.
Overall exercise can enrich the microbiota diversity, increase the Bacteroidetes-Firmicutes ratio, stimulate the proliferation of bacteria which can modulate mucosal immunity, and improve barrier functions.
Diet is an established modulator of gut microbiota composition and activity, with marked changes in microbiota composition evident within 24 h of a dietary modification.
Protein intake appears to be a strong modulator of microbiota diversity, with whey protein showing some potential benefits that need further study in humans.
Higher intakes of carbohydrate and dietary fiber in athletes appear to be associated with increased abundance of Prevotella.
The specific effects of fat on the gut microbiota is difficult to isolate, however, the types of fats consumed appear to be important.
Key Points 2 – Probiotic Supplementation and Performance
To date single-strain probiotic supplementation has produced a significant aerobic performance benefit in only one study.
Supplementation with multi-strain probiotics has been reported to increase VO2 max, aerobic power, training load, and time to exhaustion in several studies, but more studies have not found such an effect.
In response to muscle-damaging resistance exercise, probiotic supplementation (paired with protein) can expedite recovery and decrease soreness and other indices of skeletal muscle damage.
The effect of probiotic supplementation on body composition has been mixed and requires further research.
Probiotics supplementation as an ergogenic aid for performance enhancement requires further investigation and may be indirect via modulation of other systems.
Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host (FAO/WHO).
Key Points 3 – Effects of Probiotic Supplementation on Immune Function
Athletes may compromise their immune status with high training loads (over-reaching, over-training) which can increase the risk of illness such as URTIs.
Overall, the current body of evidence indicates small variable benefits of probiotics during intense training, particularly in endurance athletes, the cohort where the majority of studies are conducted.
There is more evidence for the clinical effects of probiotics reducing the incidence URTI and related illness.
Positive changes in circulating and salivary immune markers have been more variable and require further research to define more clearly.
Key Points 4 – Probiotic Supplementation and Gastrointestinal Health.
GI problems often occur in endurance athletes and can impair the delivery of nutrients, cause GI symptoms and decrease performance. A small number of studies assessing GI benefit in athletes and physically active individuals have yielded mixed results with considerable variation in methodology, making comparison difficult. Positive results reported included decreases in concentrations of zonulin and endotoxin, intestinal hyperpermeability and duration of GI-symptom episodes. Key Points 5 – Mechanisms of Action
There are dozens of bacterial strains that can be considered as probiotics, particularly those that produce lactic acid. However, each strain is unique with respect to how it responds to and affects the host. The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of probiotics in athletes are largely unknown but are likely to be multifactorial. Consumption of some probiotic strains may improve intestinal barrier function by modulating tight junction permeability. However, the mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal barrier function are not sufficiently studied. Adhesion of probiotics to the intestinal mucosa may be a mechanism for modulation of the immune system. Probiotics also cause alterations in intestinal mucins that prevent pathogen binding. Probiotics may support microbiota and postbiotic production which possess different functional properties including, but not limited to, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory. Probiotics may enhance innate immunity by upregulating immunoglobulins, antimicrobial proteins, phagocytic activity, and natural killer cell activity, and also enhance acquired immunity by improving antigen presentation and function of T and B lymphocytes to neutralize pathogens and virally-infected cells. Probiotics can potentially modulate intestinal permeability and health of the cells of the gut lining improving nutrient absorption including minerals, peptides, and amino acids by decreasing inflammation and encouraging optimum development of the absorptive area of the villi. Key Points 6 – Safety and Health.
Probiotics have been used safely in foods and dairy products for over a hundred years. Well-studied probiotic species include Bifidobacterium (ssp. adolescentis, animalis, bifidum, breve, and longum) and Lactobacillus (ssp. acidophilus, casei, fermentum, gasseri, johnsonii, reuteri, paracasei, plantarum, rhamnosus, and salivarius). Safety assessments should take into account the nature of the probiotic microbe, method of administration, level of exposure, health status of the recipients, and the underlying physiological functions the microbes are intended to perform. Four classes of possible side effects are commonly reported from probiotic use in vulnerable patient groups: systemic infections, detrimental metabolic effects, cytokine-mediated immunologic adverse events in susceptible individuals, and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. The current body of research of probiotic supplementation for healthy athletes and physically active individuals suggests that they are safe for use. Caution is warranted for those with serious health conditions. In these instances, patients should consult with their health care practitioner before supplementing. Consumers are advised to supplement with probiotics strains and products within evidence-based dosages.

1326,2019-12-23 03:29:00,Share a favorite habit/supplementation of yours that you think is contributing to your long term cognitive health and well being.,"
Lol did you think I sat down and did calculus to get those numbers? They are rough approximations based on my own experience and the arguments that I laid out. The numbers don't even matter anyways, since they just serve to illustrate my point which already agrees with you that lifestyle is far more important than supplementation.
To justify the 30% to you - I would say that I believe many people have severe nutritional deficits in at least some areas. Vitamin D (due to everyone being indoors all the time or slathered in sunscreen when they are not), magnesium, zinc, and vitamin A are often not present in high amounts in the average diet. You can radically change your diet to ensure optimal intake which is much more ideal than supplements, but this can be expensive and many people struggle to do so overnight. So I think for these people, supplements can give them a boost to improve their wellbeing while they adjust their lifestyle to get them those nutrients naturally.
Secondly, I think another large group of people have various undiagnosed syndromes/disorders. This can range from inflammatory regulation problems (typically I am not a fan of blindly taking anti-inflammatories since I believe you should try to find the cause of the inflammation), heavy metal exposure (poor drinking water quality or lead pipes, country with unregulated pollution, etc), pesticide exposure (again countries with low regulation being the concern), subchronic infections due to weakened immune system (if caused by stress, certain supplements can moderately reduce the reduction caused), etc, etc. I believe these people can significantly benefit from the right supplement, but again, it takes careful research and self-examination to be sure you're not blowing your money on BS.
And finally, I totally acknowledge that for some people, they simply do not need any supplements. I think if you have an optimal and varied diet, you don't really need vitamin supplements (besides vitamin D). If your health is good, I am not a believer in taking supplements just to ""prevent"" something unless you have good reason (i.e family history of a specific disease and there's a supplement that has been found to possibly help)

I can hardly wait for the time vaccines get the full-spectrum scrutiny every other pharmaceutical gets before release.
You mean like the several year process on willing volunteers to check for adverse reactions that's done every time we want to administer a new one? Like MenB, which took 20 fucking years of testing to ratify?
That and some actual studies on what injecting foreign DNA does to massive populations of people and cancer rates.
Are you aware of how the immune system works and what it does?
Are you aware that heavy vaccination of a populace is necessary to stop people who are undergoing cancer treatment from contracting otherwise very minor diseases and then die from them?
Have you got any studies that suggest older or current vaccines have any increased risk of cancer? Are you aware that certain vaccines have been developed that provably stop certain cancers?
Oh, that and the tightrope walk that physicians are forced to walk when people report adverse events but its too much trouble to fill out the confusing paperwork and bias causes them to tend to say its not related to the vaccine.
You mean like allergic reactions to certain vaccines, which we know of and understand, and aren't caused by the actual payload as much as they are by supplementary elements designed to provoke the immune system into a higher response that you can get the vaccine without?
Not to mention societal pressure makes it hard to say literally anything against any specific vaccine for the thundering roar of ""ANTIVAXXER! KILL THE NONBELIEVER"" from the collective masses, even if concerns are valid.
There are no valid concerns. Vaccines are an incredible defence against microorganisms that would otherwise kill millions of us every year. They protect people like you from your own ignorance by creating very difficult conditions for them to spread.

While I've consulted several doctors in the past including GPs and specialists, some of whom went to extraordinary lengths to help me, nothing turned up even after a lot of discussion and different tests. I also move very frequently because of the nature of my job and it's difficult to find continuity and the same level of care everywhere I go. Where I live now, it's more of a mechanical situation (you have an infection, here's the antibiotics) and I'd probably be laughed off if I go with this list.
Also, given the psychosomatic association and seasonal nature of some of the symptoms, I've resigned to googling and taking Tylenol when it's really bad. Any input or pointers is helpful.

Hello all,
I had a few questions about maximizing the effectiveness when receiving/administering the HPV vaccine, Gardasil 9. I would love to know if the circumstances I mention below have even the slightest effect on efficacy of the vaccine.
Is it better to alternate arms when receiving multi-dose vaccines like Gardasil 9? For example, if the first dose was given on the left arm, would it be better to receive the 2nd dose on the right arm, switch back to the left arm for the 3rd dose, etc.?
Is it advisable to try and strengthen the immune system before receiving the vaccine? For example, would it be better to exercise vigorously and take Emergen-C/other immune system-boosting supplements several hours/days/a week/a month before the vaccination date? Would that affect how well the body could respond to the vaccine (i.e. producing antibodies, speed of reactions, etc.)?
Does shaking a vaccine vial thoroughly before administration affect its efficacy? I only ask this because I received the first dose from a pharmacy at a supermarket chain, and the administrator did not seem to shake the vial before administering (which I saw being recommended in several different protocol sheets for the vaccine).
How much less 'protected'/less immune would someone be after the 2nd dose of a 3-dose cycle (0/2/6 months) without getting the 3rd dose? Is full, up-to-3rd-dose immunity required before being exposed to the virus?
Thank you so, so much everyone! I apologize if any of my questions were silly in any way, I was just seeking better understanding and was hoping to learn from you all. Thanks again, and I wish everyone a wonderful day/week!

Or... we could figure out how to treat the cause with non-intrusive interventions instead of the symptom with surgery and implanted devices.
Establishing a healthy gut biome from a mostly plant based and organic diet with other nutritional interventions like soil based probiotic supplementation is very doable... it treats any number of immune disorders and mental health issues... all of which are affected by the signals sent along the vagus nerve... signals, we are finding more every day, are directly affected by the gut biome.
It was recently discovered that bacteria in our gut are responsible for the production of about 85% of our serotonin... But you can’t patent a nutritional intervention, and fluorinated antidepressants like most SSRI’s are big ass business. Guess what! They also destroy your healthy gut bacteria just like antibiotics!

1357,2020-02-01 00:29:00,I've finally been prescribed Stelara!! Doubts about the adverse effects.,"
All systemic drugs lower your immune system. All systemic drugs can cause opportunistic infections such as sinusitis, as well as other side effects such as fatigue, headaches, and gastrointestinal unpleasantreis. Depression is a possible side effect with some biologics. They also add a slight cancer risk.
In the case of Stelara, your best source of information is the FDA label. Here's the warning section:
Infections: Serious infections have occurred. Do not start STELARA® during any clinically important active infection. If a serious infection or clinically significant infection develops, consider discontinuing STELARA® until the infection resolves.
Theoretical Risk for Particular Infections: Serious infections from mycobacteria, salmonella and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinations have been reported in patients genetically deficient in IL12/IL-23. Diagnostic tests for these infections should be considered as dictated by clinical circumstances. Tuberculosis (TB): Evaluate patients for TB prior to initiating treatment with STELARA®. Initiate treatment of latent TB before administering STELARA®. Malignancies: STELARA® may increase risk of malignancy. The safety of STELARA® in patients with a history of or a known malignancy has not been evaluated. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Anaphylaxis or other clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions may occur. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS): One case was reported. If suspected, treat promptly and discontinue STELARA®. Side effects:
nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and fatigue.
There is no systemic drug that doesn't have side effects. At the moment, the ones that look the best are Tremfya (guselkumab) and Skyrizi (risankizumab), which are the two newest IL-23 inhibitors that have so far shown themselves be more effective and have fewer side effects than any other biologics on the market.
As for the immune system, there's no way around that. If you're concerned about specific diseases, make sure you are vaccinated, and if vaccines aren't available, avoid exposing yourself to the risk. Nobody knows how the 2019-nCoV coronavirus will pan out; maybe there will be a vaccine by the time you travel. It's a good idea to consult with your doctor about such fears.
There's not much you can do to ""boost"" your immune system here. I wouldn't put any faith in dietary supplements, for example.
By the way, there's no evidence that methotrexate can cause birth defects through male sperm. For example, see this paper .

It doesn't lower chances of getting the flu. Once you've come into contact with the virus, your immune system fights off the infection. The original comment was correct in saying itll help you survive it.

No one knows how many people have been infected. Considering China quarantined 50,000,000 there are likely many more than just the 80k that got it, rode it out like the flu, and moved on. The 80k were identified cases (meaning severe enough to go in and get checked out), the 2k dead are well dead. I don't know about you but I get a flu every few years and never go in to get it checked out, just deal with it. So it could be that millions were actually infected and the vast majority had no major symptoms. This is similar to the flu, many people get it, a small percentage (usually the old and very young) die from it.
Now that being said, you have to actually trust the numbers out of China in the first place. They have an aging population, many smokers, and terrible environmental conditions - death rates in the west seem to be lower especially when severe cases are identified early.
Is it different than the flu, yes, it is definitely more dangerous. However there is also a fair amount of media fear mongering here as well, they make bank when this kind of shit happens. CNN runs 24x7 and needs something to keep people interested 24x7. Goes by the old adage, if it bleeds it reads.

1380,2020-02-03 16:47:00,"Let's discuss how to make our immune systems stronger and general personal hygiene tips, instead of how to deal with a single pandemic.","
I posed this a while back:
There are many aspects of being healthy and resilient in the face of viral pandemic . Of course you already are prepared with protective gear and a bucket of hand sanitizer . But how can you prepare your body in case you are exposed?
Decrease your stress levels. Get rest and sleep. Stress and sleep deprivation raise your cortisol levels. This is a potent suppressor to your immune system. Get enough sleep. Remove stressors. Sleep. Likely one of the larger contributors to immune health.
I take a few supplements that have decent evidence for boosting immune health: garlic, honey, elderberry, echinacea.
Elderberry and it’s various extracts have a substantial body of data regarding its ability to suppress viral infection. Decreased infection rates, shorter duration of symptoms and decreased symptom severity. I can post pubmed articles if you would like, but quick googling will take you there. Also it’s delicious. I take a teaspoon of Sambucol every evening . When sick ramp it up to every 2 hours.
Garlic. Garlic contains Allicin. Allicin has antiviral , antibacterial and antifungal activity. Crushing garlic is associated with higher allicin levels. There are also numerous other health benefits to garlic but
Honey. Many wound care clinics use honey as topical treatment for infected wounds. It also is effective as a topical antiviral especially on oral lesions. Honey contains Methylglyoxal which is believed to be one of the main reasons for these effects. It’s good for oral health.
Personally, I ferment honey and garlic together. You can google recipes but essentially it is a lacto-fermentation of whole cloves of garlic and honey. It takes a month before it’s good, lasts years. They honey is delicious over ribs, wings, on pizza or pretty much anything. I eat a clove of honey with most meals for it’s immune boosting effects . Retains the allicin levels or raw garlic but after a month is more mild, less sharp, more pleasant to chew.
Echinacea. Several studies note some antiviral and anti inflammatory properties.
Fermented foods and live cultures make for a more resilient gut biome

1384,2020-02-16 17:42:00,"Once you catch coronavirus, is it too late?","
If you get the virus you have like a 25% chance of developing pneumonia. From the data I've seen even with medical treatment once pneumonia sets in your odds are low. Worldwide it's around 14% case fatality and assuming 25% developed serious symptoms that means 14/25 (56%) of serious cases end in death. There seems to be higher fatalities in older people, those who smoke or have pre-existing conditions however I've also seen mention of cytokine storms which is an overreaction of your immune system which puts healthier individuals at risk as well. Two examples are the famous 35-ish year old doctor who died. He was probably on the healthier side and the 34? Year old in Seattle who developed viral pneumonia but was ultimately saved by an experimental anti-viral. For now we really don't know and can only hope for the best (but considering the absolutely unprecedented actions of the Chinese gov I have to assume the virus is also unprecedented and therefore worse than I expect but that'd just me)
Edit: just as a piece of reassurance YES people can and have recovered. However we do not know the extent to which they are recovered. This is a virus and we know some viruses like herpes or HIV never go away. Others, like influenza can be tamed by the body but regularly mutate to re-infect people who have already been exposed. Some like chicken pox typically do not return after being exposed and recovering once. If it behaves like SARS your body should create antibodies after recovery to prevent re-infection. This is what I'm praying for and seems likely considering I've seen reports of success in treating patients with blood taken from those who have recovered (the idea is after recovery your blood will contain the antibodies needed to defeat covid and these antibodies can be transferred to those suffering the disease to supplement their immune system) again only time will tell and we gotta stay informed and stay positive

PEA( Palmitoylethanolamide) has been shown as an effective alternative to flu shots
garlic(aged garlic like kyolic)
berberine(never take with antibiotics makes them toxic)
4+g dosages of buffered vitamin C (best every four hours but 2-3 times a day would be good)which is the threshold where it starts acting like an oxidant which is when it's most effective. Vitality C is the only I'd recommend over cheap buffered sodium ascorbate if you want to pay for something better, their studies claim it keeps plasma vitamin C levels up for 10 hours vs 3-4 with normal buffered, lipsomal is around 3-5. So vitality C would require just morning and night dosage and likely easier tolerated for higher dosages.
also keep vitamin D+A(not beta carotene) levels up.
Any first flu signs in addition to seeing a doctor and the above supplements, up vitamin A to 100 000-250 000 IU+ 15 000-20 000 IU D3 for 2-4 days max, lysine inhibits viral replication, up vitamin C 4+grams to bowel tolerance and every 4 hours, unless vitality C then bowel tolerance twice a day. A person can also have some results rna acs silver set aside and take an ounce every day for a few days, it's extremely strong and one will likely get a herxheimer reaction from the massive bacterial and viral load drop and the body processing all that waste(you could also take the recommended daily dose when not sick but the important take away is having enough for a large dose or two.)
​
One can also look into baking soda protocol for viral infections. This is very simple but done usually with medical supervision like in a hospital for acute life threatening viral infections that need to be resolved fast, one takes dosages of backing soda enough to raise the alkalinity of the body short term 2-3 days or so which inhibits viral replication. It's done for acute life threatening viral infections and should be respected as such. So something you can ask your doctor to look up on. It's also an option for those in rural ares of the country/world where medical attention isn't an option. Hope this helps.

Lower levels of vitamin D can let your immune system accidentally start targeting your own body tissues, in this case your nervous system.
Here's a PubMed article with an overview of a study they did studying this effect
The prevalence of autoimmune diseases (ADs) has increased over the past few decades. Vitamin D deficiency is a common factor in many of these diseases, whose etiology remains poorly understood. The objective of this study was to review published data on the role of vitamin D in ADs. Vitamin D insufficiency has been described as an important factor in the development of some ADs, generally attributed to the key role of this vitamin in the immune system. Most studies show that adequate supplementation can prevent and improve the development of some of these diseases, although the optimal vitamin D dose remains controversial. We highlight the importance of measuring serum vitamin D levels of the population and developing strategies to improve and maintain levels with no health risks.
Vitamin D is just a part of this system, and there are a number of other factors that can lead to ADs such as genetics. Vitamin D is an easy and cheap preventative measure for a large number of people though, especially in today's world where people are inside more and more

And like once every 10 days I take 100mg phenylpiracetam.
I still take kratom like twice per month, which I always combine with unifiram (I find unifiram to really boost kratom's effects and duration).

I thought I developed other auto immune diseases but after some Genetic testing we discovered that I have 2 gene mutations that are impacting my health. One, I can't process fats very well as fuel/ketones to replace glucose for energy and my other gene doesn't produce Glucose very well for energy for my brain and the rest of my body. I can't have carbs as it increases my autoimmune symptoms so I have to supplement 200grams a day of D-Glucose and im good now.

Do a little research people. They even say, right in the image, to read the full story on their site. This appears to be a case of poor wording choice.
From their website:
""A healthy diet rich in fruit and vegetables, protein foods and whole grains is important for a strong immune system as are other healthy lifestyle habits (e.g exercise, not smoking, adequate sleep, managing stress etc).
There are many nutrients that are involved with the normal functioning of the immune system and therefore we encourage eating a variety of nutrient rich healthy foods each day in order to support immune function. ""
Obviously, they think that a healthy diet is good for your immune system, as it is.
What this appears to be addressing is the tons of snake oil people are pushing that claim to boost your immune system. As if you can just eat this, or take this supplement, and it will make you better. The way to strengthen your immune system is to be healthy, which is something they actually push.
But let's not reality get in our way. I'm shocked at how little research people will do into these things. This literally took me about 20 seconds to find.

We should remain on high alert for ADE but no models, studies, tests or papers have shown any ADE as of yet and it's getting more and more unlikely that it will happen.
The likelihood has not changed at all. Because they have not checked where it is likely, when there are low affinity and/or quantity of the antibodies:
To evaluate the efficacy of existing vaccines against infection with SHC014-MA15, we vaccinated aged mice with double-inactivated whole SARS-CoV (DIV). Previous work showed that DIV could neutralize and protect young mice from challenge with a homologous virus14; however, the vaccine failed to protect aged animals in which augmented immune pathology was also observed, indicating the possibility of the animals being harmed because of the vaccination15. Here we found that DIV did not provide protection from challenge with SHC014-MA15 with regards to weight loss or viral titer (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). Consistent with a previous report with other heterologous group 2b CoVs15, serum from DIV-vaccinated, aged mice also failed to neutralize SHC014-MA15 (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Notably, DIV vaccination resulted in robust immune pathology (Supplementary Table 4) and eosinophilia (Supplementary Fig. 5d–f). Together, these results confirm that the DIV vaccine would not be protective against infection with SHC014 and could possibly augment disease in the aged vaccinated group.
https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985
We found that higher concentrations of anti-sera against SARS-CoV neutralized SARS-CoV infection, while highly diluted anti-sera significantly increased SARS-CoV infection and induced higher levels of apoptosis. Results from infectivity assays indicate that SARS-CoV ADE is primarily mediated by diluted antibodies against envelope spike proteins rather than nucleocapsid proteins. We also generated monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins and observed that most of them promoted SARS-CoV infection. Combined, our results suggest that antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins may trigger ADE effects. The data raise new questions regarding a potential SARS-CoV vaccine, while shedding light on mechanisms involved in SARS pathogenesis.

Hey guys! I need your opinions on this type of autoimmune therapy. My psoriasis recently got worse due to stress of the pandemic and I've been looking at more intensive methods to combat it.

I'm apprehensive on it because A. When they say overload they mean OVERLOAD, and B. The therapy is expensive enough to be on par with biologics.

I have had heart surgery and my blood oxygen levels are usually low. Wearing a mask makes that much worse, but the mask nazis don't want to hear about that.
I don't throw a temper tantrum. I wear one if I have to in order to get my job done, but that's it, and I generally wear it so I can breathe through my nose. It's easier than talking to idiots who feel they have a right to ask me why I'm not wearing a mask. My health condition is none of your business.
There are studies that indicate they do not work, and there are studies that indicate they might work slightly, and there are studies that indicate masks actually make it more likely a person will contract the virus since they can help weaken the immune system by lowering blood oxygen.
There's very little public discussion of effective ways to build up your immune system, such as taking vitamin supplements (especially Vitamin D and Vitamin C), exercise, fresh air, and avoiding isolation. The real number of cases and deaths due to covid is anyone's guess, since that entire process has been politicized, but it is apparent that the death rate is far lower than the 5% initially proclaimed five months ago.
Bottom line is that there's no way you'll be able to avoid it forever. It is going to make its way through the entire herd eventually. You can't run from it. The logical thing is to work on improving your overall health and immune response, but the only discussion allowed is ""wear a mask, social distance, wash your hands.""
Grow up, stop telling others what to do, get some fresh air and exercise. I promise you'll be okay. That's the real unpopular opinion, Karen.

The exact same thing has been happening to me since the pandemic started. I've been doing my best to control my anxiety without having to smoke weed because any ""symptom"" I might have gets worse whenever I smoke, especially coughing/throat soreness as it's expected.
Apart from barely going out (me and my family have the unfortunately not widespread privilege of working and studying from home), we've been pumping our supplement intake to give our immune systems a boost. I know it might not necessarily prevent us from catching the virus if exposed, but at least it can help with recovery time and intensity of the symptoms. For around 5 weeks now, my anxiety has reduced a bit as well as some of the ""symptoms"".
Another thing that has helped me is to reassure myself that external factors can also contribute to some similar COVID-19 symptoms that might show up from time to time. Where I live, the Saharan dust has been fucking with us for a while, causing congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, and even a high fever in some people.

I'm a teacher going back to school in about a month. I've bought a KN95 mask to go under a cloth mask and will wear a face shield as well while at work. Despite what was being spread at the beginning of this pandemic, masks do actually protect you as well as protecting others. Maybe this would work for you?
Make sure you bring hand sanitizer with you to the airport and change out of your travel clothes ASAP. Start taking Vitamin D supplements to boost your immunity. And please do not go anywhere you do not need to go. If you should happen to get sick, you don't want to spread it to anyone else.

1449,2020-08-19 02:29:00,Does anybody know of any outdoor restaurants or activities that are rain or shine? Need some ideas,"
Hi, hope everyone is doing well. So I have some chronic health conditions and while I am young, I've been isolating since March pretty much since I don't want to take any chances with this virus.
However, I'm going to be visiting family and friends this upcoming week, especially my grandfather as he has cancer and unfortunately may not have much longer, so I wanted to visit before the fall when cases may surge. I am both excited and nervous, but since I've been so alone for almost half a year (and I live alone) i feel this trip is needed for my mental health.
FWIW I own a p100 respirator and some kf94 masks, as well as various cloth and surgical masks and I will be bringing goggles, lysol wipes, hand sanitizer and some immune support supplements that I'm all bringing with me. I took a test a few days ago that came back negative for asymptomatic infection.
I haven't hung out with my friends in a long time and I'd like to do so in a safe manner. It does seem like it'll be raining a lot in Hampton Roads this week. Our original plan was an outdoor beach picnic with takeout food but I'd like to have a backup in case of severe weather. the problem with hanging out at their houses is that they live with parents or extended family and they're (rightfully) weary of inviting me into their homes after traveling. I will be staying with my parents during the trip. I could potentially bring my friends to my parents' house to hang out as a last resort but I'd rather try something else first.
Does anybody happen to know of any restaurants with rain or shine patio seating, or any activities that can be done safely and which enforce masks and distancing, etc?
I'd like this trip to be safe for my family (especially my grandfather), my friends, myself and the community at large. I'd appreciate any suggestions!
thanks and stay safe!

I really think the US/Sweden strategy is going to be looked back on as the correct one. Even when we develop a vaccine, it's only going to be like ~50-70% effective and only ~50-70% of the population will be willing take a brand new vaccine rushed through the regulatory process under these conditions.
That gives us immunity in the range of 25% to 49%, which is not even close to high enough for her immunity. We're likely going to need this to spread a bit in healthy people to supplement the vaccine with some natural immunity too.

MS is an autoimmune disease (ADs), and vitamin D deficiency is a known factor in causing/exacerbating ADs. From a general sense, vitamin D is involved in your body's immune system to help it find the correct targets (bacteria, virus', etc). Lower levels of vitamin D can let your immune system accidentally start targeting your own body tissues, in this case your nervous system.
Here's a PubMed article with an overview of a study they did studying this effect
The prevalence of autoimmune diseases (ADs) has increased over the past few decades. Vitamin D deficiency is a common factor in many of these diseases, whose etiology remains poorly understood. The objective of this study was to review published data on the role of vitamin D in ADs. Vitamin D insufficiency has been described as an important factor in the development of some ADs, generally attributed to the key role of this vitamin in the immune system. Most studies show that adequate supplementation can prevent and improve the development of some of these diseases, although the optimal vitamin D dose remains controversial. We highlight the importance of measuring serum vitamin D levels of the population and developing strategies to improve and maintain levels with no health risks.
Vitamin D is just a part of this system, and there are a number of other factors that can lead to ADs such as genetics. Vitamin D is an easy and cheap preventative measure for a large number of people though, especially in today's world where people are inside more and more

I have been feeling similar symptoms like you and I've been told its prolly related to anxiety (you could be having a wave of panic attacks that makes these symptoms linger. Panic attack symptoms are near exact that of covid - including nausea, diarrhea, shortness of breath, feverish feeling with no fever, etc.) Continue to monitor your temperature and try your best to take your mind off of it. You can also take vitamin and zinc supplements to help strengthen your immune system as a precautionary (I want to point out that I am not a medical professional, these are things I have been doing myself).
Please just try and keep a positive mind (I know its hard but that's all we can do!) Giving you my best well wishes

For the few poor souls in the sub who aren’t completely deluded by quack-medicine conspiracy theories:
Yes eating a healthy balanced diet is important for maintaining your health.
What this statement is trying to say is that there is no special diet - or some magic combination of vitamins or expensive “nutritional supplements” - that will “boost” your immune system and protect you from COVID.
“Natural health products” and the vitamin and “nutritional supplement” industry are generally giant scams / snake oil peddlers.
Provided you are eating a basic healthy balanced diet and don’t have any genuine deficiencies buying boxes of vitamin C tablets etc. is unlikely to help.
Anyone promising that their specific vitamin pill, magic powder or “natural herbal supplement” will prevent COVID is lying to you.

Start with writing down what you actually eat every day for a week and see how you calories balance out. From there you can maybe try to add in snacks between meals and tweak what you are eating to ensure you are getting what you need. Also, it's not a bad idea to look into supplements (vitamin D, fish oil if you don't eat fish often, calcium if you aren't big on dairy, zinc/vitamin c for immune support, etc). I would only recommend supplements for things that you truly are not getting enough of over a long term span. You can have a blood chemistry panel done to see if you have acceptable levels of vitamins.

map annoints
teal (low tier maps) or crimson (high tier maps) are best for rewards. teal is probably better for you now
clear/sepia/amber/indigo make the maps easier in order if increasing cost and effectiveness. amber might be the sweet spot
ring annoints
scout range is a cheap general purpose one that is good for picking off stragglers and supplementing single target but doesnt offer massive dps or cc if your build is struggling with clearing blight
meteor tower fires an additional meteor is expensive but the absolute GOAT in terms of single target damage increase. each ring is 100% increased damage for meteor towers which have massive range and single target damage.
my personal favorite is empowering tower tower range as it helps you get around shitty layouts which is the biggest barrier to increasing your consistency. sometimes theres just no good spots where an empowering tower can hit 3+ nearby towers and this helps fix that.
i like 1x meteor tower fires an additional meteor and 1x empower tower range.
overall strat
keep the tab screen open at all times, it is almost impossible to tell where enemies are without it with all the tower attacks on screen
dont place towers too early. the first minute or two only a few portals are active and you should have no problem keeping these clear on your own. wait until more branches form so you can see where towers will be most effective.
after a minute or two there should be 2-3 main paths directly touching the pump. your first priority is to get a few minion towers and chilling towers on these paths close to the pump to stop stragglers from damaging the pump. about halfway through the encounter a new path that directly touches the pump will usually spawn. if your existing towers dont cover this make sure to drop some new towers. eventually upgrade these towers to sentinel towers and glacial cage towers respectively. minion tower can still be very effective left at level 3 so don't prioritize this. glacial cage tower is much more effective than chilling tower so this upgrade is more important.
once you have some low tier minion/chilling towers near the pump prioritize getting meteor towers for a bit. identify a spot a little further from the pump than your crowd control towers where you can place an empowering tower where it will hit 3-4 other tower spawns. i usually do level 1 empowering > 1 meteor tower > level 3 empowering > 1-2 more meteor towers. once this is set up you should be able to leave that section of the map alone for a bit to focus on defending the other sides. always finish fully upgrading a meteor tower before building more fireball towers, the difference between a meteor tower and a level 3 fireball tower is massive.
this is a good point to level up your minion/freezing towers a little bit and check for new paths
now build a similar cluster of 1 level 3 empowering and 2-3 meteor towers covering a new section of the map on the other side of the pump from your first cluster.
at this point almost all of the portals should be active. your towers will be killing tons of stuff giving you a lot of points to build more towers. revisit the pump and finish leveling up your minion/chilling towers and place new ones for any new paths or where monsters are breaking through. if there is a remaining angle your first two empowering/meteor clusters arent covering build a third cluster. otherwise just slowly add more meteor towers on the angle monsters are getting through. once you get ~10 meteor towers they will do most of the killing for you can you can just pick off stragglers while upgrading and building. at this stage it can be tempting to go far from your pump but a small group of stragglers can still end your run quickly. wait until only a few paths are active then run to the portals to pick off the stupid wheel guys that dont go towards the pump for whatever reason.
seismic tower level 3 boosted by a empowering tower level 3 can stun lock most non-boss monsters. these are amazing to place with your meteor clusters when multiple paths converge on a single point, or to replace/supplement your minion/chilling towers when there are portals immune to those effects near the pump. they arent as reliable for bad layouts but are very strong on already easy layouts

Zinc 30mg per day
Selenium 200mcg per day
Vitamin C 2-3 GRAMS every 8 hours (cease use after 5 days)
N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) - a precursor to glutathione - 600-900mg per day Stay away from pro inflammatory herbs and supplements like Elderberry, echinacea, goldenseal, garlic, etc. those upregulates the same systems in the body that lead to cytokine storm which is the concern with COVID so they’re not appropriate for this illness.

My parents, 79 & 81, take a teaspoon of colloidal silver every day as a supplement to 'boost' their immune system. They do not believe in alternative treatments and will always go to the doctor when they are sick and know that taking the medication prescribed is the best course of action. They do not use any other natural or holistic remedies as a cure.
Mum has just finished chemotherapy with a full recovery from cancer, she praises her doctors and our healthcare system knowing full well that the silver did not contribute to her remission although she does believe that it it helped strengthen her immune system during her treatment.
She also says that the teaspoon of silver settled her stomach and was the only thing that eased the nausea from chemo, solidifying her belief that the silver is beneficial as a supplement.
I know brass and silver kill germs and did not think there was a reason to be worried about mum using silver as a supplement, until now.
Can you please suggest a reliable website with scientific facts explaining the pros, if any, and cons of colloidal silver as a supplement? I need to research the shit out of this for my mums sake.

Animal testing has a notoriously bad reputation for no reason. Animals for testing arguably have a by far better standard of living than almost every other animal we use. Livestock have to have it good enough to pass some minimal regulations, and to not die. But in animal testing, a distressed or poorly treated animal will not make a good candidate for any experiments. You can't pump them full of antibiotics to supplement a failing immune system, as is standard practice for livestock. They need to be healthy to make a good candidate.

Results
Clinically, there were significant improvements of mastodynia (p=0.004), tremor (p=0.048), and restless leg (p=0.009) (Table 3). There was no statistically significant effect of I supplementation on blood pressure, body temperature and body composition (Table 4). Percent body fat reached a near significant drop (p=0.075). Regarding laboratory evaluation of the subjects, results of urine analysis were normal in all subjects pre- and post-I supplementation. The only statistically significant effect of I was on urine pH (p=0.012) with preand post-I values (mean ± SD) respectively of 6.05±0.69 and 7.00±0.85. (Reference Range: 5.0-8.5). Out of 17 different measurements performed on blood chemistry, nine were affected significantly by I supplementation: a drop in creatinine (p<0.01), calcium (p=0.04), albumin (p<0.01), A/G ratio (p<0.01), alkaline phosphatase (p<0.01); and a rise in sodium
(p=0.01), carbon dioxide (p=0.02), globulin (p=0.01), and SGPT levels (p<0.01). However, all those values remained well within the reference ranges for these parameters (Table 5). Three hematological measurements out of the 13 assessed were significantly altered by the intervention: a drop in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (p<0.01) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) (p<0.01); and a rise in mean platelet volume (MPV) (p=0.04). Although the above differences were statistically significant, they represented a small percentage of the mean values compared (Table 6). The values for MCH and MCV were within the reference ranges both pre- and post-I supplementation. However, the mean value for MPV (± SD) was below the normal range of 8.2-10.3 ƒl prior to intervention (7.5±1.3 ƒl) and increased to reach the normal range following I supplementation (8.2±1.3 ƒl). Although MPV below 4 ƒl is an indication of a compromised immune system, this slightly low mean value prior to I
supplementation may not be of clinical significance. Nevertheless, the effect of I supplementation was beneficial on this parameter. The data on thyroid function tests and thyroid volume are displayed in Table 7. Thyroid volume in all the subjects were below 18 ml, the upper limit of normal values reported,14,15 suggesting that their intake of I prior to this study was adequate to prevent enlargement of the thyroid gland, and to maintain normal thyroid hormones, since all these values were within normal limits. Serum T4 levels dropped significantly (p<0.01) from a mean of 8.8 (SD=1.3) to 7.2 ug/dL (SD=1.1). However, all individual values remained within the reference range (Table 7). Mean serum TSH levels decreased following I intake from 4.4 mIU/L to 3.2 mIU/L. This non-significant decrease was due to the marked fall in subjects #1 and #10, with 16 mIU/L decrease between these two subjects.

An employee at Sprouts turned me on to a supplement called Kick Ass Immunity Activator for when you feel a cold coming on, works like a charm! They also make a version for when you’re already sick; highly recommend IMO, tastes like dirt but way better than getting sick.
Ps: I do not own stock in this company but would invest in a second

I don't recommend taking this advice, but taking Kratom definitely would help with focus. Takes away a little of the pain of everyday life and gives you a bit of energy. A healthier but less effective way of achieving this but one I would endorse wholly is the root supplement ashwagandha. Great nootropic and stress-reliever which also boosts the immune system.

1483,2019-06-11 09:43:00,Tumour removal surgery tomorrow? What should I ask the vet beforehand and how do I prepare?,"
Hi all,
My rat Obi is going in for a tumour removal finally, it was supposed to be on the 25th but since it’s grown so rapidly he’s going in tomorrow.
I wanted to ask you all for some tips on what to ask the vets, I know I need to ask about what anaesthetic will be used, how to care for wounds, antibiotics and if I should separate him from his brother- but other then those I don’t know what else to ask. He’ll be getting dropped off in the morning and kept until the evening to make sure he’s okay if that helps.
Also, what can I do to help him heal? I’m going to make him a little sweater out of a sock today to keep him from possibly biting sutures and I have syringes to feed him sugar water and also bought these items:

http://www.ratwarehouse.com/product/drs_tiny_animals_essentials (vitamins to help his immune system) and http://www.ratwarehouse.com/product/drs_calcivet (calcium supplements.)
Any help is much appreciated!❤️

Bowenoid Papulosis: 33,Male. Any advice? ​
Hey everyone,
First time posting here on this sub. Found out back in December from biopsy that I have what is called Bowenoid Papulosis. It's rare form of the HPV virus that is linked with strain 16 according to what I have read online, but I never was told which strain I am dealing with. They just said ""high risk"" over the phone. I started Aldara treatment back in January for 8 weeks and then took a break from it due to the side effects being painful, but then finally went away. My female dermatologist wants me to do another 8 weeks which I am currently on week 10 of 16. I've been doing what I can to boost my immune system--working out 3-5 days a week, taking vitamins/supplements (I'll post them below), non smoker, cut down on the beer drinking, and eating healthy whenever I can. I am also getting the third round of the shot in July. Has anyone ever had experience with having BP? AHCC is one of the new ones I started taking in April, but I've only been taking 2 pills in the morning. Am I ok with taking AHCC with all of these other vitamins at once? I found out about these vitamins from this article-- https://www.foxnews.com/health/have-hpv-how-to-clear-the-infection-naturally
Any kind of support is much appreciated!

Diet is obviously critical in supporting a healthy gut biome. I’ve noticed a significant change over the past 12 months after changing to a low carb, sugar free diet, especially with reduced inflammation, increased energy, clearer thinking, etc. I’ve also noticed that there are foods that I can no longer eat because of how my gut now reacts to them : garlic being a good example. Is there a diet or any specific foods or supplements you’d recommend to support an ageing immune system?

1487,2019-06-10 02:59:00,Euprenolepis procera: The (only) ants that eat mushrooms as their primary food source.,"
Woah that’s really interesting. So many interesting bits—
They have been observed to eat over 30 species of mushroom, but they also ignore 50 species present in their habitat;
I wonder what their criteria are? I’m not a Pleurotus fan, so I doubt they’re using mine.
They harvest them efficiently, removing over 70% of the mushroom within four hours. In a laboratory study, they almost completely harvested a Pleurotus mushroom that weighed 40 grams (1.4 oz) within three hours
Would be a great time lapse .
Once they have harvested the mushrooms, they transport pieces of them back to their nest and arrange them into piles 1–4 cm (0.4–1.6 in) in diameter. Over time these piles turn from white to black, losing mass as workers continuously chew and feed on the fungi and in turn feed the ant larvae. The pulp has a distinctive sweet-sour odour, which Witte & Maschwitz suggested may be due to fermentation occurring. This food processing continues for around a week, depending on the size of the original pile of pieces. If the fungal material is kept away from the ants it quickly spoils, becoming infested by bacteria and smelling unpleasant, but when processed by the ants no spoiling has been observed. The exact mechanisms of the processing of fungi are under investigation.
How many years away are we away from some enterprising moron bringing ant produced mushroom jelly supplements to the market that increase “immune system health”
